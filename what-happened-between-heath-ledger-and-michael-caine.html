Over the decades, the part has been played by actors Ian Abercombie, Michael Gough, and Jeremy Irons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Douglas Hodge (The Joker) and Andy Serkis (The Batman) have also stepped into the shoes of Alfred Pennyworth in the most recent iterations.</p><p>Michael Caine was first offered the role in the early 2000s, as Christopher Nolan assembled his cast line-up for Batman Begins, the first installment of what would end up being The Dark Knight trilogy.</p><p>The director originally had Anthony Hopkins in mind for the part, but the Hannibal actor refused, and the opportunity arose for Caine.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Facts You Didn't Know About The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></span></p><p>In order to convince Caine to agree to the gig, Nolan personally delivered the script to his country house in Oxfordshire, England.</p><h2 id=michael-caine-enjoyed-working-with-christopher-nolan>Michael Caine Enjoyed Working With Christopher Nolan</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Christopher Nolan first delivered the script for Batman Begins to Michael Caine's house, the actor had no idea who he was.</p><p>"The doorbell rang, and I was near it, so I answered it. And there was a man standing there with a script in his hand and he said he was a director of movies," Caine said in an interview with Variety Magazine last year.</p><p>That would become the beginning of a very fruitful partnership <a href=#>and friendship</a> between the two men, one that Caine came to thoroughly enjoy.</p><p>"Playing the movie was absolutely fantastic," he reminisced, before going to explain what he thought made Nolan special: "The thing about Nolan is you don’t always know what’s going on in the scene, as an actor. And you ask him, and he says, 'I’ll tell you after you’ve done it.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Christopher Nolan's 10 Best Movies, Ranked According To IMDb</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Caine would go on to reprise the role in The Dark Knight (2008), and eventually in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).

"He did me the first time I saw him, because we did a rehearsal on the first day, and we hadn’t met or anything. He had to come up in an elevator to our home, Batman’s home. I’m thinking I’m letting friends in, instead of which he’s killed them all, and he’s coming up in the lift.</p><p>"So on the first rehearsal, when the bloody door opened on that lift, he came tearing out," Caine continued. "I forgot every line. Terrifying."</p><p>At that moment, he knew what the rest of the world would soon come to realize as well: Ledger had created one of the best characters of modern day film.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 'The Dark Knight' Has Said About Working With Heath Ledger</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmoJWWwal5y56boJ2iYq6vsIymoJygkZq5bq%2FAoqWeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-bachelor-what-is-hannah-browns-job.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Hannah Browns Job?">&larr;
