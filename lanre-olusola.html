By the time you look back to join the dots, you’ve become a conqueror.”</p><p>“You can do anything if you BELIEVE and PRACTICE.”</p><p>“You must first love God and accept His love for you,<br>without this you can’t know what love really is and you can’t give it.”</p><p>“Go out there today and every day – Live to Love; Love to Live for yourself and others.”</p><p>“…LOVE is a genuine dedicated commitment towards the<br>wellbeing of another.”</p><h4>More Quotes</h4><p>“REPENT from killing and destroying people unknowingly through your unbelieving thoughts, words, and deeds.”</p><p>“Life is about dreaming and aspiring. Life is about transcendency and helping others attain their dreams. Believing and hoping the BEST in others is the key to their success.”</p><p>“…We should stop talking about change if we all can’t stay<br>and speak one voice and sacrifice for the next generation.”</p><p>“Perception is everything. Your perception is stronger than reality, your perception is your own reality. The way you see the problem is the problem.”</p><p>“Have a vision, anticipate all that can stop you and put contingency plans in place! A vision gives you current sight, foresight, insight, and hindsight.”</p><p>Nobody ever had it smooth all the way. Success is never a function of luck or chance. It requires time and practice. Success is the reward for hard work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1foa6vvsRmpqWto6S5ons%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./people.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lynxxxs biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr;
