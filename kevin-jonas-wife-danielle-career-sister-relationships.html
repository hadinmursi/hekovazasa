"It's a love-hate. I feel like I am torn," Kevin and Danielle married in Long Island in 2009 and have two daughters together.</p><p>The former hairdresser opened up about being <a href=#>the only Jonas wife who was not famous</a> before marrying their spouse. "The two boys married somebody who [are] actresses, they're out there, everyone knows them," Danielle Jonas said about her sisters-in-law, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Sophie Turner, on The Lady Gang podcast. "I feel like I'm Danielle. And it's hard."</p><p>Danielle has also admitted that she sometimes wishes she could have “something else” to her name when she compares herself to Chopra and Turner. Danielle, Priyanka and Sophie have appeared in two Jonas Brothers music videos together, teaming up for 'Sucker' in 2019 and 'What a Man Gotta Do' the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-kevin-jonas-meet-his-wife-danielle>How Did Kevin Jonas Meet His Wife, Danielle?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kevin-jonas-danielle-jonas.jpg><p>Kevin Jonas met his future wife, hairstylist Danielle Deleasa, during a family vacation to the Caribbean. She admitted that she "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't know who the Jonas Brothers were</a>," at the time. It was her older sister who gave Kevin Danielle's phone number.</p><p>It was love at first sight for Kevin who thought, "Gosh, every time I see Danielle, her hair looks so pretty, it’s like someone did it.’ And she was the one who always did it. It just looked like she always took care of herself. She always presented herself in a good way, and that just really attracted me.

"So why would I spend time away from my family while we’re on vacation? I was like, 'why should I waste my time?'”</p><p>Kevin Jonas made a point to prove to her that he wasn't looking for a fling and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted something more long term</a>. Kevin explained, "I was the one that was pursuing her most of the time and I didn't want her out of my sight. She actually ran away twice."</p><p>He admits he even tracked her flight, so he could call her the minute her plane landed back in Jersey. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I cyberstalked her after we met</a> and cyberstalked to see what flight she was going to be on coming home, and then I called her the minute she landed. That might have been a little overboard, but I just went for it," the 'Sucker' singer recalled in a 2012 interview with Glamour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-danielle-jonas-does-for-a-living>What Danielle Jonas Does For A Living</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/danielle-jonas-kevin-jonas.jpg><p>Danielle Deleasa was born and raised in Denville, New Jersey.

I’m into very simple, pretty jewelry,” she revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Sophie Turner's Relationship With Her Jonas Brothers Sisters-In Law Ever As Positive As Instagram Made It Look?</a></span></p><p>While pregnant with her first daughter Alena, Danielle and Kevin partnered with Dreft to launch an app called Amazing Baby Days that allowed couples to document the important moments of their child's life. She even live-tweeted the birth of her first daughter as a part of the partnership.</p><p>The couple also appeared in the short-lived E! News‘ reality show Married With Jonas for two seasons from 2012-2013. Reflecting on the show a decade later, Kevin Jonas admitted, "At times it was difficult. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doing a reality show is always a challenge</a>. But for us, doing a show was great."</p><p>Kevin has also admitted that he can't help but rewatch the show every now and then. "We were children. We were babies. We got married so young.
