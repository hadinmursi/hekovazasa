For proof of that fact, all you have to do is look at <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio’s romantic history</a> since it sometimes seems like he starts dating someone new every week. On top of that, the fact that so many <a href=#>celebrity couples have broken up recently</a> says a lot as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celeb Couples Who Famously Broke Up...And Got Right Back Together</a></span></p><p>Ever since Phoebe Waller-Bridge first rose to international fame, it has been extremely clear that she is far too talented to be boxed in. Despite that, a lot of people expect Waller-Bridge to act like a typical celebrity but the fact that she goes her own way is one of the reasons why Phoebe is beloved. Still, just like other stars, there are a lot of people who are interested in Waller-Bridge’s love life which is why they question whether or not she is still dating Martin McDonagh.</p><h2 id=who-are-phoebe-waller-bridge-and-martin-mcdonagh>Who Are Phoebe Waller-Bridge And Martin McDonagh</h2><p>Ever since the early-2010s, it has been clear that Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a talented actor as she made her mark on a slew of different movies and TV shows. However, it wasn’t until 2016 that Waller-Bridge became one of the most talked-about talents in Hollywood after the series Fleabag was released and became a sensation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Fleabag’s creator, head writer, and star, Waller-Bridge was the main engine behind the hit series. Far from done, Waller-Bridge went on to develop the show Killing Eve for television and she was that series’ head writer as well. On top of being a major TV star, Waller-Bridge also voiced and performed droid L3-37 in the Star Wars film Solo: A Star Wars Story and she is set to star in the upcoming Indiana Jones sequel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Indiana Jones 5' In The Works, Phoebe Wallard-Bridge To Star Alongisde Harrison Ford</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there is no doubt that Martin McDonagh isn’t as famous as Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he still is extremely accomplished and talented. A British playwright, screenwriter, producer, and director, McDonagh is the main force behind several acclaimed films. After all, McDonagh wrote and directed In Bruges and he wrote, directed, and produced Seven Psychopaths and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. A former Academy Award winner for Best Live Action Short Film, McDonagh has been nominated for an additional three Oscars. Since McDonagh and Waller-Bridge are both so talented, @sebpatrick summed up their relationship perfectly when he tweeted “holy COW can you imagine how well-written their conversations must be”.</p><h2 id=everything-that-is-known-about-phoebe-waller-bridge-and-martin-mcdonagh-rsquo-s-relationship>Everything That Is Known About Phoebe Waller-Bridge And Martin McDonagh’s Relationship</h2><p>Ever since Phoebe Waller-Bridge first rose to fame, it is has seemed like she is the furthest thing from a shy person. With that in mind, most fans likely would have assumed that Waller-Bridge would be the kind of star who shares every detail of their relationships whenever they are dating. In fact, some fans may have expected Waller-Bridge to be the kind of star that people have to tell to tone down the PDA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Celebrity Couples Who've Recently Been Told By Fans To Tone Down The PDA</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, Phoebe Waller-Bridge And Martin McDonagh greatly value their privacy when it comes to their romantic relationship. Sure, when Waller-Bridge won an Emmy in 2019 she kissed McDonagh before she took to the stage and the couple has appeared at red carpet events together. However, it seems incredibly clear that Waller-Bridge and McDonagh will never be the kind of <a href=#>stars that tip off the paparazzi about where to find them</a>. In fact, when Waller-Bridge was interviewed by The Guardian in 2018, she was asked if McDonagh has made her the happiest she’s been in a relationship. In response, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Waller-Bridge simply said, “I’m not going to talk about that”</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, the one area of her relationship with Martin McDonagh that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been willing to talk about is how they interact as artists</a>. For example, when Waller-Bridge spoke to The New York Times she said she is “less inclined” to show McDonagh her in-progress scripts. Later Waller-Bridge told The Telegraph that she sometimes lets McDonagh see “a little bit” of her incomplete scripts. Most notably, during the aforementioned The Guardian interview, Waller-Bridge revealed that McDonagh’s work has excited her about something she never felt that way about in the past. The reason for that is that when Waller-Bridge saw McDonagh’s “The Pillowman”, it was "the first play (she) saw that made (her) think theater can be really exciting."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-phoebe-waller-bridge-and-martin-mcdonagh-still-together>Are Phoebe Waller-Bridge And Martin McDonagh Still Together?</h2><p>In life, some things are pretty universal. For example, the vast majority of people who are above a certain age have experienced a breakup and know how that feels. Even though most people should be able to understand that love doesn’t last sometimes, a lot of people become personally invested in their favorite celebrity couples. For example, since Phoebe Waller-Bridge And Martin McDonagh are both exceptional people who seem perfect for each other, a lot of their fans want to see them go the distance as a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to whosdatedwho.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Martin McDonagh are still a couple</a> to this day. However, as a result of the fact that Waller-Bridge and McDonagh have tried to keep their relationship private, it seems unlikely that they would announce anything if they broke up. With that in mind, the only publically available answer to the question of whether or not Waller-Bridge and McDonagh are still a couple is probably. After all, neither of them has moved on to a new relationship as far as the public knows.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Fleabag’ Director Brought Some Phoebe Waller-Bridge Magic To ‘Enola Holmes’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWgnbymrsRmrpqknJq%2Fbq7RopugnV2owaq4y2agp2WRYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnWoquhZZ2Wv7W1zWaknJyfo66otIxrZ2tqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./isabelle-mcnally-bio-wiki-parents-age-boyfriend-movies-net-worth-and-bates-motel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Isabelle McNally Bio, Wiki, Parents, Age, Boyfriend, Movies, Net Worth and Bates Motel">&larr;
