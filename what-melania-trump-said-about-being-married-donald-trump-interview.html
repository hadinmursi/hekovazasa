Back then, Donald Trump and Melania Trump got married in 2005 amid a lot of press coverage.</p><p>These days, Trump fans want to know everything about him, including <a href=#>how much he spent on renovating Mar-a-Lago</a>. However, one thing that Trump's fans likely assumed they could never know is what it is like to be married to The Donald. However, Melania Trump spoke about what it was like to be married to Donald Trump during a 2005 interview.</p><h2 id=melania-trump-told-the-shocking-truth-about-being-married-to-donald-trump>Melania Trump Told The Shocking Truth About Being Married To Donald Trump</h2><p>Between being the President of the United States, running for office, posing on social media, and more, Donald Trump has never been shy. As a result, many observers who love or hate Donald Trump believe they have a good idea of what his personality is like. However, based on what Melania Trump once told Larry King, most observers really don't understand who Donald Trump is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/does-barron-trump-have-a-loving-relationship-with-his-father-donald-trump_.jpg><p>On January 22nd, 2005, Donald Trump and Melania Trump got married. At that time, there was a lot of coverage in the media about the details of the couple's big day. Given that Donald Trump has always loved to show off his wealth, it makes sense that observers were dying to know how elaborate his third wedding would be.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How long did Donald Trump's marriages last</a>, according to Who's Dated Who?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Wife's Name:</p></td><td><p>When They Got Married:</p></td><td><p>Current Status:</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ivana Trump</p></td><td><p>April 9th, 1977</p></td><td><p>Divorce Finalized December 1990</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Marla Maples</p></td><td><p>December 19th, 1993</p></td><td><p>Divorce Finalized in June 1999</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Melania Trump</p></td><td><p>January 22nd, 2005</p></td><td><p>Still Married</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the Trumps were married, that certainly wasn't going to be the end of the media circus if Donald Trump had any control over that. Instead, Donald Trump and Melania Trump granted their first interview as a married couple to Larry King roughly three months later.</p><p>Since they had only been married a matter of months, some could argue that Melania Trump didn't know what it would be like to be Donald Trump's wife. However, since the couple had been together for many years before their marriage, Melania Trump almost certainly had a very good idea.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/was-king-charles-relationship-with-donald-trump-complicated-by-the-former-president-aggressively-flirting-with-princess-diana_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Was King Charles And Donald Trump's Relationship Complicated By The Former President 'Aggressively' Flirting With Princess Diana?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Donald Trump reportedly "aggressively" tried to romance Princess Diana after she got divorced from King Charles</span><p>When King began interviewing the Trumps, his first questions focused on how they met and became a couple. However, the topic eventually changed and King began questioning Melania Trump about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what it is like to be Donald Trump's partner and wife</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, Larry King asked Melania Trump an interesting question. "Is he a control freak?" In response to that question, Melania Trump confirmed that Donald Trump has high expectations for everything in his life while still defending her husband.</p><p>"I don't think he's a control freak. He's a perfectionist... Maybe he makes demands in his business because he needs to. You know, he's kind of a general. He needs to, you know, have people in line. But not at home. We are very equal in the relationship and that's very important."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donald-trump-and-melania-trump-leaving-the-white-house.jpg><p>From there, Melania Trump went on to express her opinion about the kind of woman someone has to be to marry Donald Trump.</p><p>"You know, to marry a man like Donald, is, you know, you need to know who you are. And you need to be very strong, and smart, and you know, he needs to know he can rely on me sometimes. You know? And we share a lot of stuff together. I don't think he's a control freak at all."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>King then went on to ask Melania Trump if Donald Trump brought work home with him. In response, Melania Trump revealed that anyone who is married to Donald Trump has to know his career keeps him very busy.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_donald-trump-jr-embraced-being-continuously-booed-at-his-book-launch_bk_a2-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Donald Trump Jr. Embraced Being Continuously Booed At His Book Launch</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Donald Trump Jr.'s reaction to being heckled at a book signing garnered headlines all over the world.</span><p>"But he's working all the time. You know, Saturdays, Sundays, he's playing golf. He's working all the time... It's his passion. He loves it. It doesn't bother me. I don't want to change him. I don't want, you know, to say come home and be with me. I don't want to change him. I want to give him space and I think that's very important in a relationship."</p><p>At this point in the conversation, King began talking to Donald Trump about his views on marriage. As Donald Trump expressed his opinion that you shouldn't have to work on a marriage, Melania Trump physically expressed her agreement. The implication seemed to be that neither of them felt they had to work hard on their marriage at that time.</p><p>As the interview progressed, Melania Trump told King that she cooked for Donald Trump sometimes. However, she stated that the two of them went out together far more often than they stayed in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/melania-trump-donald-trump-1.jpg><p>Given that Donald Trump has always boasted about his fortune, King's next question to Melania Trump made perfect sense. When King asked what it is like to be able to afford anything she wanted since she was Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump assured him she was not a big spender. In response, Donald Trump completely agreed. "She has never taken advantage of that situation, as many women would have, frankly."</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When and where was Melania Trump born</a>, according to Britannica?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Born on April 26, 1970</strong></li><li><strong>Born in Novo Mesto, Yugoslavia (now known as Slovenia)</strong></li><li><strong>53 years old as of January 2024</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In arguably the most interesting part of the conversation, Larry King began talking about the nice and generous side of Donald Trump. King then asked Melania Trump what the public didn't know about her husband and she began singing Donald Trump's praises.</p><p>"Amazing heart. He likes to help people. He has friends. He's loyal to it. He is, great sense of humor. Great sense of humor... The way he is, he cares about people."</p><p>The final notable thing that Melania Trump said about her marriage to Donald Trump came when King asked if she was worried about infidelity. "No. I don't worry about that at all. I know who I am and if a man doesn't want to be with me, or, I don't want to be with a man."</p><h2 id=what-donald-trump-said-about-melania-trump-as-a-mother>What Donald Trump Said About Melania Trump As A Mother?</h2><p>When Donald Trump and Melania Trump sat down with Larry King in 2005, a wide array of topics came up.

According to what Donald Trump told King, he believed that adults who can afford to, should have many kids.</p><p>Donald Trump then went on to talk to Larry King about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what kind of parents he believed he and Melania Trump would be</a> together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/donald-trump-and-larry-king-at-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame.jpg><p>"If you have the money, having children is great. Now, I know Melania, I'm not going to be doing the diapers, I'm not going to be making the food, I may never even see the kids, Frankly. No, she will be an unbelievable mother. I'll be a good father, but I'll be, you know, doing my deals... She'll be an amazing mother. I have no doubt about that.
