The couple first met in the early 2000s but according to People, they didn't start dating until 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian and West have always been known for their extravagant displays of affection. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From renting out entire stadiums for date nights to buying each other over-the-top gifts</a>, they've never been shy about showing their love for each other.</p><p>However, their relationship has not been without its challenges. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to TMZ</a>, Kim filed for divorce from West in 2021 after months of rumors about their separation. Despite this, they remain committed to co-parenting their four children.</p><p>With West re-marrying Bianca Censori, many have wondered how she's joined in on the co-parenting, if at all. Here's the truth about her relationship with West and Kardashian's famous kids.</p><h2 id=here-39-s-a-timeline-of-bianca-censori-and-kanye-west-39-s-relationship>Here's A Timeline Of Bianca Censori And Kanye West's Relationship</h2><p>Before discussing West and Censori's relationship, it's important to get the background of what happened between West and Kardashian. Everyone knows who they are and the general gist of things, but some details are essential when it comes to how it kickstarted West's hot new love affair with Censori.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-42.jpg><p>According to E! Online, Kardashian filed for divorce from West in early 2021. Insider then reported that West was being asked to pay $200,000 for child support, which began a series of West privately and publicly asking for her to come back.</p><p>According to People, Kardashian would rebound with comedian Pete Davidson, while West initially rebounded with model Irina Shayk. The bigger news from that was how angry West was with Davidson, which started one of the biggest one-sided beefs in celebrity history. According to Insider, West privately and publicly mocked Davidson, even claiming that the Staten Island native looked like a "troll".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Tall Is Kanye West Compared To 9 Other Famous Rappers?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>West has been banned from Australia before</a>, so while the public may not have sided with him during this beef, it isn't the first time he's done something really controversial.</p><p>West and Davidson's odd yet public beef has been the source of attention when it comes to West's non-music life. West’s love life then became the main topic of conversation again after he was reportedly linked to Censori — two months after his divorce from Kardashian was finalized. According to Us Weekly, the couple has been in a “steady relationship” since October 2021.</p><p>The two have reportedly been working on a clothing collection together and have been inspiring each other throughout their relationship. The couple has even been spotted together on several occasions, including at the Balenciaga show during Paris Fashion Week in March 2022, per TMZ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/did-kanye-west-quickly-remarry-because-of-his-religion_.jpg><p>But who exactly is Censori? Despite her marriage to someone like West and all the attention she's garnered from it, many people still don't really know much about her personal life and background.</p><p>According to The New York Post, Censori is an architectural designer who works for West’s brand Yeezy. According to Parade, she met West when he slid into her Instagram DM's and invited her to work for him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Grimes And Kanye West Are Helping Elon Musk With His Most Ridiculous Project Yet</a></span></p><p>Censori even moved from her hometown of Melbourne, Australia to Los Angeles to join his team, which was quite a risky move on her part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bianca and West got married in a secret ceremony in January 2023, not too long after they started dating. They were seen wearing rings and holding hands in Beverly Hills shortly after their reported wedding ceremony. After that, West released a song called “Censori Overload” during thee holidays, having a whole song dedicated to his new beau.</p><h2 id=how-does-kim-kardashian-feel-about-kanye-west-39-s-new-wife-bianca-censori>How Does Kim Kardashian Feel About Kanye West's New Wife Bianca Censori?</h2><p>West and Kardashian may have had a fairy tale love at one point in time, but it's been long over. West and Censori seem to be pretty well in love, while Kardashian told James Corden that she's "happily single" right now, and isn't looking for anything.</p><p><a href=#>Censori has gotten a lot of comparisons to Kardashian</a>, which has made things naturally awkward. So how does the reality show star truly feel about her ex-husband's newest lover?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-white-dress.jpg><p>According to She Knows, Kardashian is not bothered by West and Censori’s relationship in the slightest. Kardashian is not concerned about what West does with his romantic life at all, as long as he keeps up his duties as a father to their kids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Might Be Using Taylor Swift For Publicity, According To Fans</a></span></p><p>Kardashian has also reached out to Censori through her team, congratulating her and asking for a private meeting to get to know her better. Kardashian wants to establish some ground rules for co-parenting with West and Censori, such as guidelines on care, food, electronics, and naps for the kids.</p><p>So Karashian's main concern regarding Censori is how she treats 4 of the most famous kids in the world as step-mother. Just how good is Censori's relationship truly with West and Kardashian's children?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-bianca-censori-get-along-with-kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-39-s-kids>Does Bianca Censori Get Along With Kim Kardashian And Kanye West's Kids?</h2><p>West and Kardashian had four children together - North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm West. <a href=#>They all got along well with Pete Davidson</a> when he was dating Kardashian. Here's how their relationship with Davidson differs from theirs with Censori.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-real-reason-why-north-_nori_-west-is-not-allowed-to-operate-her-instagram-handle-on-her-own.jpg><p>There has been little information regarding Censori's relationship with West's children, but what has been released has been pretty telling.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nicki Swift</a>, North was not very welcoming of Censori at first. She was loyal to her mom and did not want anyone else to take her place. She was also confused and hurt by her dad’s sudden marriage and his controversial statements about her mom and their family. She was reluctant to meet Bianca and did not warm up to her easily.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bianca-censori-has-a-mysterious-relationship-with-kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-s-kids-here-the-truth-about-it.jpg><p>According to The Source, Saint was more curious and carefree about Bianca. He liked her creativity and wanted to learn more about her work as a designer, something he shares with his dad regarding his focus on art and expression. He was also impressed by her Australian accent and "wanted to visit her country someday".</p><p>The two younger West-Kardashian children are too young to understand what's going on, but it appears they get along well with Censori. There seems to be no drama at all when it comes to Censori's relationships with her new husband's kids, which is something all parties involved should be and are happy about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqapmnq4sdKtZKedp2LEqrLEZpmimZ6Yrm6vxKeqqKqZYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnWoquhZZueum63wKubmquYnq6vv4ycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brad-pitt-hasnt-introduced-girlfriend-kids-worries-angelinas-reaction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brad Pitt Still Hasnt Introduced Girlfriend To Kids As He Worries About Angelinas Reaction">&larr;
