There’s something important to know when you see Spike Lee’s explosive BlacKkKlansman, which is based on the bizarre exploits of black Colorado Springs undercover detective Ron Stallworth: Since Lee’s days as an NYU graduate film student, he has publicly stewed over D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation and wanted to savage it onscreen — which he does here, definitively. In one of BlacKkKlansman’s most stunning scenes, Stallworth (John David Washington) watches Ku Klux Klan initiates and their proud families at a screening of Griffith’s film: They’re repulsed on cue when shiftless blacks take over a southern legislature, enraged when a pure white virgin throws herself off a cliff rather than submit to a black man, and enraptured when the holy Klan gallops in to avenge the death, dumping the black man’s corpse in his town as a warning.</description></item><item><title>Stars With Weird Body Parts</title><link>/stars-with-weird-body-parts-2013259.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stars-with-weird-body-parts-2013259.html</guid><description>Nobody’s perfect, not even our favorite celebrities!
