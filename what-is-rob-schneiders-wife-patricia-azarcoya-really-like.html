Despite the fact that she's appeared on screen next to her famous husband, few people know what Patricia Azarcoya Arce is really like in real life, or who she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also doesn't help that not only is Patricia much younger than Rob, but she also came from outside the United States, making it even harder for fans to learn more about her. At least, to learn more than what Patricia herself has revealed.</p><p>So who exactly is Rob Schneider's wife, and what is she really like?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rob Schneider Said A Hillary Clinton Sketch On SNL Marked The Moment The Show Died</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-patricia-azarcoya-arce>Who Is Patricia Azarcoya Arce?</h2><p>The most noteworthy thing about Patricia Maya Schneider, as she's listed professionally, is that she's an actress. She's clearly familiar with her husband's industry and was even when they met more than a decade ago. In fact, it's almost rude to call it Rob's industry when Patricia has quite a few <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb credits</a> to her name, apart from her projects with her now-spouse. Patricia seems to spend most of her time as a producer, though she has acted on and off in a couple projects since 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Rob.png><p>Among <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other little-known facts about Patricia</a> is that she was also a model before meeting her husband. But it's her work on various Mexican TV series as a producer that suggests she's evenly matched with her hubby. Later, the two also worked on a series together called 'Real Rob,' and Patricia's producing experience likely helped there as well.</p><p>Clearly, Patricia is a professional and knows what she's doing. But that doesn't explain why there's very little information online about her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kelsea Ballerini Went Completely Off-Script During Her SNL Performance And It Stunned Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-old-is-rob-schneider-39-s-wife-patricia-azarcoya>How Old Is Rob Schneider's Wife Patricia Azarcoya?</h2><p>One of the things that's intriguing about Rob Schneider and his now-wife is that she is way younger than him. Apparently, she's only about five years older than Rob's daughter, Elle King. That had heads turning at first, even before anyone knew Patricia Azarcoya Schneider's specific birth year.</p><p>It was clear she was much younger than Rob, and people weren't sure what to make of that at first. <a href=#>Rob Schneider has also been married several times before</a>, and fans wondered how long his marriage to Patricia would really last.</p><p>Now that more than ten years have passed, however, fans are much more accepting of the long-married couple -- even though their age gap is 20 years.</p><p>Besides, the two have kids together now, so anyone who thought they weren't in it for the long haul was apparently mistaken. But what is Rob Schneider's spouse like when they aren't in front of the cameras? There are some hints.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-rob-schneider-39-s-wife-patricia-like-at-home>What Is Rob Schneider's Wife Patricia Like At Home?</h2><p>The one thing that helps fans figure out just who Rob Schneider's wife is and what she's like is her social media. Unlike other less-famous spouses of famous folks, Patricia doesn't shy away from posting on social media just because of who her hubby is. Ever since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they met in 2007 on a show she was producing</a>, Patricia has not shied away from sharing her life with Rob.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rob-And-Patricia-Schneider.jpg><p>In fact, she shares a lot and often. From Patricia's Instagram, it's clear that she enjoys dancing, cooking, and hanging out with her "husbando." But mostly, what Patricia's IG proves is that she has just as solid a sense of humor as her man does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She often posts quips about their jokes and life at home and even captioned a post with a slight dig at her hubby (and husbands everywhere).</p><p>She may be a former (probably still current, judging by her posts!) model married to one super-wealthy Hollywood star, but Patricia seems impressively down to earth. She focuses on fitness at home and in the dance studio, spends plenty of time outdoors and with her family, and also finds time to donate to worthy causes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adam Driver Purposely Extended His Opening Monologue On SNL So He Wouldn't Have To Take Part In The Final Sketch</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-patricia-schneider-like-as-a-stepmom-to-elle-king>What Is Patricia Schneider Like As A Stepmom To Elle King?</h2><p>Most fans know that <a href=#>Rob Schneider hasn't always had the best relationship with his oldest daughter</a>, especially since Elle King took her mom's last name rather than her dad's. But it seems that things are much better between Elle and her dad these days, despite or possibly because of her stepmom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The family seems to travel together, allowing Elle and her two little sisters time to hang out. And it seems that Elle and Patricia get along well, too. Fans hope so at least, especially since Rob's been remarried for such a long time.</p><h2 id=fans-don-39-t-know-what-to-think-of-rob-schneider-39-s-wife>Fans Don't Know What To Think Of Rob Schneider's Wife</h2><p>She has a lot of Instagram followers -- almost as many as her husband, in fact -- but not all of them think so highly of Patricia. Comments often call her out as a "sugar baby" when she posts snaps with Rob (he's <a href=#>worth a relatively cool $12M of course</a>), and other fans talk about how young she looks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rob-Schneiders-Wife.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's understandable that fans can't quite figure out how she wound up with Rob, or rather, how Rob wound up with her. Sure, she's not in her 20s anymore, as she was when the couple met, but Patricia Maya Schneider seems to be a perfect match for her husband.</p><p>She's funny, knows the industry inside and out, and doesn't seem embarrassed or concerned by all the critical comments on her social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edGomWark527prXDnqmsZaees6Z5z5qrq6GTnq5urdmaqZynqZZ6s7HApaOyZZyeuKZ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-toby-keith-dead-or-alive-battling-stomach-cancer-442743-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Toby Keith?
