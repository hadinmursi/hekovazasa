And to be sure, it has many more songs and cues than either <i>Anchorman 2</i> or <i>American Hustle</i>. (The fact that it’s three hours has something to do with that.) But at its best, the music is used as a propulsive, rhythmic element, driving the movie forward and linking scenes together — several songs stretch across different scenes, disappearing and then returning minutes later. <a href=#>Bo Diddley’s “Pretty Thing”</a> soundtracks the wild orgy on Jordan’s bachelor party plane, then vanishes, then comes back at the end of his wedding. <a href=#>7Horse’s “Meth Lab Zoso Sticker”</a> starts in the scene where Brad’s wife is getting money taped across her breasts, continues into the moments when she (and others) funnels money across the Swiss border, and continues into Brad and Donnie’s fight in the parking lot. <a href=#>Plastic Bertrand’s “Ca Plane Pour Moi</a>,” lends the Benihana bust scene (“Beni-FUCKING-HANA”) a punky, yet silly, energy.<b></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-21-0-0@published data-word-count=4><b>So which is best?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-22-0-0@published data-word-count=117>Look, Martin Scorsese is a music master, okay? (Remember the beginning of the paranoid Ray Liotta helicopter scene in Goodfellas, soundtracked by <a href=#>Harry Nilsson’s “Jump Into the Fire,”</a> or the <a href=#>“Be My Baby” opening from</a> Mean Streets?) Not only because his movies feature good music — and here, not a Rolling Stones song among the bunch — but also because it’s wide-ranging and complex. The Wolf of Wall Street could have gone for a wall-to-wall eighties and nineties soundtrack, but instead spread its selections over decades (Bo Diddley to Foo Fighters), styles (blues to hip-hop), and even languages. It’s nowhere as obvious as Anchorman 2 and has nearly none of the Zemeckis-lite, on-the-nose choices of American Hustle.<b><br></b></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Soundtrack Check: <i>Anchorman</i>, <i>Wall Street</i>, <i>Hustle</i></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdgZny0u9Snm62qkZi4bq%2FHnpqkZZiqwLW4xGefraWc</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-gina-stewarts-daughter-casey-the-worlds-hottest-grandma-claims-she-dated-shane-warne-in-secret-390723-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Gina Stewarts Daughter, Casey?
