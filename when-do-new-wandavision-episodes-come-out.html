Just like every other WandaVision episode up to this point, WandaVision Episode 8 will premiere on Disney+ this Friday at <b>12:01 a.m. Pacific</b> or 3:01 a.m. Eastern.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-day-do-wandavision-episodes-come-out></span>What day do WandaVision episodes come out?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When is the WandaVision Episode 1 release time? WandaVision will likely follow the same pattern as The Mandalorian, with its episodes becoming available Fridays on Disney+ at 12:01 a.m. PT/3:01 a.m. ET, <b>starting Friday, January 15th</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-the-wandavision-episodes-come-out-weekly></span>Do the WandaVision episodes come out weekly?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The first two episodes of WandaVision premiered Jan. 15. After the initial two episode drop of WandaVision, one of Marvel’s weirdest shows ever, Disney Plus assumed a more regimented schedule, releasing <b>one episode per week</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-there-be-a-wandavision-season-2></span>Will there be a WandaVision season 2?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>WandaVision spoilers follow – including the season finale.<p>Marvel boss Kevin Feige has been characteristically vague about <b>a potential second season</b> of WandaVision or, in fact, any of the new superhero shows heading to Disney+.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-time-does-wandavision-episode-6-come-out></span>What time does WandaVision Episode 6 come out?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>12:01 a.m. When is the WandaVision Episode 6 release time? WandaVision Episode 6 becomes available to stream on Disney+ this coming Friday at <b>12:01 a.m. Pacific</b> or 3:01 a.m. Eastern.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-wandavision-only-have-2-episodes></span>Why does WandaVision only have 2 episodes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Aside from a two-episode premiere, Marvel only <b>releases one new episode of WandaVision each week</b>. So with two episodes remaining, that means we’ve got two weeks left before the whole thing is finished.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-episodes-of-wandavision-are-coming-out-on-friday></span>How many episodes of WandaVision are coming out on Friday?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To start the ball rolling not just one, but the first two episodes of WandaVision will air on Friday 15 January, with new episodes to follow every Friday for seven more weeks. That’s <b>nine episodes</b> in total. It’s being anticipated that every Friday a new episode will drop at 12am PT /3am ET in the US and 8am in the UK.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-will-the-next-wandavision-episode-be></span>How long will the next WandaVision episode be?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>47 minutes What’s going on? Per ComicBook.com, a noted “WandaVision” leaker said the next episode of the Marvel show will last for <b>47 minutes</b>. The same leaker said that Episode 7 would be 37 minutes, which proved to be accurate, per ComicBook.com.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-there-10-episodes-of-wandavision></span>Are there 10 episodes of WandaVision?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>WandaVision director Matt Shakman reveals the Marvel Disney+ series <b>once had 10 episodes planned</b>, though it was later whittled down to 9.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-wandavision-cancelled></span>Was WandaVision Cancelled?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>There won’t be a second season of ‘WandaVision</b>,’ says star Elizabeth Olsen. … It’s definitely a limited series,” Olsen said. After Cuoco suggested that her show was only supposed to be a limited series as well, Olsen responded, “I mean, I’m saying that.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-scarlet-witch-a-villain></span>Is Scarlet Witch a villain?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Scarlet Witch is first depicted as <b>a reluctant supervillain</b> along with her twin brother Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver, both founding members of the Brotherhood of Mutants.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-episode-9-the-last-episode-of-wandavision></span>Is episode 9 The last episode of WandaVision?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“The Series Finale” is the <b>ninth episode</b> and series finale of the American television miniseries WandaVision, based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and Vision. … “The Series Finale” was released on Disney+ on March 5, 2021.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-a-secret-wandavision-episode></span>Is there a secret WandaVision episode?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There are some fans who are under the impression that there’s going to be a secret 10th WandaVision episode that <b>hasn’t been formally announced</b>. However, according to WandaVision director Matt Shakman, there isn’t any truth to this theory.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-are-wandavision-episodes></span>How long are WandaVision episodes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the interview, Matt confirmed that from start to finish, this season of WandaVision is <b>six hours long</b>. He said there will be nine episodes in total. Episodes one through seven are about half an hour long with the longest one, Episode 5 being 42 minutes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-vision-gone-forever></span>Is Vision gone forever?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Well, it definitely confirms that <b>Vision is deceased</b>. Or at least, he was deceased until Wanda revived him in WandaVision. But the fact that we briefly see his lifeless face suggests he’s still deceased and Wanda is using her powers to animated him like a puppet.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-wandas-twins-deceased></span>Are Wanda’s twins deceased?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>As to the idea the Scarlet Witch children are deceased, the <b>answer is apparently no</b>; although they were never real to begin with. As it was with Westview Vision, coupling Wanda’s powers with the Mind Stone, the Scarlet Witch children were simply her sadness, hope and love. They were created.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-agathas-hands-black></span>Why are Agatha’s hands black?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Transmutation: Harkness was able to change her appearance and witch costume for that of a normal neighbor. She was also able to change a cicada into a bird and back. In her witch form, <b>Harkness’</b> fingers turn black.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-wanda-get-her-powers></span>How did Wanda get her powers?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Having undergone HYDRA boss’ Baron von Strucker’s experiments, Wanda Maximoff exhibited <b>telekinetic and mental manipulation powers</b>, while her twin brother Pietro could run at super speeds.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-wandas-kids-real></span>Are Wanda’s kids real?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Wanda’s boys are real</b>, but only inside the Hex, which is already crumbling. Without some kind of intervention, when it falls apart for good, they will likely fade away. Same as their father when he left that magical realm. That could break Wanda for good, unleashing her Chaos Magic on the whole world.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-quicksilver-in-wandavision></span>Is Quicksilver in WandaVision?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>X-Men actor made a surprise appearance in Marvel series<p>WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer has finally explained why Evan Peters was cast as Pietro Maximoff in the Disney Plus series. The X-Men actor made <b>a mid-season appearance</b> in WandaVision as Wanda’s (Elizabeth Olsen) brother, also known as Quicksilver.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-wandas-brother-quicksilver></span>Is Wanda’s brother Quicksilver?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Marvel universe threw us a massive curveball in WandaVision with Evan Peters making a surprise appearance as Wanda’s brother, <b>Pietro Maximoff</b>. It’s surprising as Evan wasn’t this universe’s Pietro Maximoff… he was the X-Men universe’s version of the superhero known as Quicksilver.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-peter-parker-after-the-snap></span>How old is Peter Parker after the snap?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Time gets a little complicated after Holland’s first solo outing as Spider-Man as, while Spider-Man: Far From Home is set five years after Thanos’ snap in Avengers: Infinity War, Peter was snapped which means that rather than being 21, he came back as a <b>16-year old</b> after the events of Avengers: Endgame.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn56mXZm8brrEsGSwmZ6Zrre10qKmp2WVpba0u8Oeqmabn6KybrvUrWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-carley-shimkus-parents-their-ethnicity-everything-to-know-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Carley Shimkus Parents?
