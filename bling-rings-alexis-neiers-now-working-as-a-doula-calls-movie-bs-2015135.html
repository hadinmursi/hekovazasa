The group of affluent high school students made national news when they broke into the homes of stars such as <strong>Paris Hilton, Audrina Patridge</strong>, and <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong>, stealing valuable jewelry, clothes, and cash worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>Neiers pled no contest to felony burglary charges in 2010, resulting in a six-month jail sentence. The Pretty Wild star left jail in 2010 after serving one month behind bars, and started a new life. She married a businessman named <strong>Evan Haines</strong> in 2012, welcoming ther first child, daughter<strong> Harper</strong>, in April 2013. Her baby also inspired her to start a new career and she is now working as a doula.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was planning on having a home birth and I ended up having a C-section,” <a href=# rel=noopener>she explained to Ravishly</a>. “It’s not the surgery itself that was so traumatic (although the recovery was difficult): It wasn’t the birth that I wanted. The way I was treated in the hospital was traumatic. I didn’t have a voice. I wasn’t being heard or acknowledged. The whole experience wasn’t great, but of course my daughter was absolutely worth it. Instead of being angry, I wanted to figure out how I could help.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/Bling-Ring-cast-051215.jpg><p>“The way pregnant women are treated is a huge feminist issue that’s not talked about,” Neiers continued. “Now I work with mommies to help them through the labor, delivery and pregnancy they desire to have. Natural childbirth is not for everybody. I like to call myself ‘the balanced doula.’ I’m not against epidurals. I’m not against hospital births. But I am pro-informed consent and having full knowledge of alternatives.”&nbsp;</p><p>Neiers also touched on her most famous pop culture reference in the interview, sounding off on the 2013 movie The Bling Ring. When the flick hit theaters under <strong>Sofia Coppola</strong>‘s direction, it was met with largely positive reviews from critics, but the real-life inspiration herself was less than impressed. She took issue with her portrayal in the film (as depicted by<strong> Emma Watson</strong>‘s character Nicki Moore) and stressed that the flick didn’t tell the whole story.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The majority of the movie was false and bulls–t,” Neiers said simply. “It didn’t touch on something that was a common thread with Nick, Tess and myself, which was severe drug addiction.”</p><p>“I’m not saying that it’s an excuse for bad behavior, but I’m saying it plays a part,” Neiers continued of the substance abuse problems she and her friends Nick Prugo and <strong>Tess Taylor </strong>faced. “The movie didn’t give an honest depiction of what our lives were really like. I wasn’t that glamorous. I was chasing around drug dealers, smoking heroin… At the time I was filming [Pretty Wild], my addiction skyrocketed because of the amount of funds I had to use and party. So, I went from smoking one Oxycontin a day, to smoking 20 a day with my sister.”&nbsp;</p><p>“My disease progressed and I was in no way capable of fighting the case,” continued the mother of one, whose fellow ring members were also handed various prison sentences. “When I went to jail, I had to <a href=# data-link=1>detox</a>, which was horrible. When you are in protective custody and you are in a cell by yourself 23 hours a day, you start to look at your life and where you’ve gone. I thought to myself, ‘How did this happen?'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmloZ6cerO1zaCqZpmcmsWqv4ynnKKdoqh6r7vWZq6oqpueu6h5wKxkmmWUpMKtrYycmKWko2K6sMLInmSbq11nfXKBkGxsaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./celebs-who-dont-look-their-age.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can You Guess How Old Cameron Diaz And These Other 11 Celebs Are?">&larr;
