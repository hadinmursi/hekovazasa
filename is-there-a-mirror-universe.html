Once a person is in this world, he or she can’t use magic, but they can touch various mirrors to see what is happening in the world that the mirrors on the other side exist in. There exists a way out of this world, a shattered mirror.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-mirror-universes-are-there></span>How many mirror universes are there?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To date, there have been <b>14 episodes across 4 series</b> that are set in the Mirror Universe. This has made for a rich and complex history, one that contains many callbacks to other episodes and is fascinating to explore.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-a-mirror-dimension></span>Is there a mirror dimension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Mirror Dimension is <b>a parallel dimension</b> that allows the user to practice their magical abilities and fight their enemies without the public’s knowledge.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-parallel-universes-exist></span>Do parallel universes exist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Parallel universes are <b>no longer just a feature</b> of a good sci-fi story. There are now some scientific theories that support the idea of parallel universes beyond our own. However, the multiverse theory remains one of the most controversial theories in science. Our universe is unimaginably big.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-created-the-mirror-universe></span>What created the Mirror Universe?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>As with so many now-iconic Star Trek conceits, the Mirror Universe started with a single one-off episode, in which <b>transporter interference</b> from an ionic storm spits Kirk, Uhura, Scotty, and McCoy out into a “parallel” universe from their own.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-to-the-terran-empire></span>What happens to the Terran Empire?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The series reveals that when exposed to individuals from the normal universe, the Terran <b>Empire began to reform itself for the better</b>, but was overthrown in the 23rd century by an alliance of alien species who took advantage of the Empire’s self-weakening and conquered it, enslaving humans and Vulcans in the process.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-time-exist-in-space></span>Does time exist in space?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Einstein showed that time and space are intimately linked and that the progression of time is relative, not absolute. Although there is nothing in physics that says time must flow in a certain direction, scientists generally agree that <b>time is a very real property of the Universe</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-universe-are-there></span>How many universe are there?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>one universe The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, <b>only one universe</b>. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-dimensions-do-we-live-in></span>How many dimensions do we live in?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>three dimensions Secret dimensions<p>In everyday life, we inhabit a space of <b>three dimensions</b> – a vast ‘cupboard’ with height, width and depth, well known for centuries. Less obviously, we can consider time as an additional, fourth dimension, as Einstein famously revealed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-1-hour-in-space-equal-to-7-years-on-earth></span>How is 1 hour in space equal to 7 years on Earth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The first planet they land on is close to a supermassive black hole, dubbed Gargantuan, whose gravitational pull causes massive waves on the planet that toss their spacecraft about. Its proximity to the black hole also causes an extreme time <b>dilation</b>, where one hour on the distant planet equals 7 years on Earth.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-age-slower-in-space></span>Do you age slower in space?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>We all measure our experience in space-time differently. That’s because space-time isn’t flat — it’s curved, and it can be warped by matter and energy. … And for astronauts on the International Space Station, that means they get to <b>age just a tiny bit slower than people on Earth</b>. That’s because of time-dilation effects.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-time-have-a-beginning></span>Does time have a beginning?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Time <b>begins when it starts ticking</b>, that is, when physical processes take place in the background of a classical space-time. Anything that happened before has been erased from cosmic memory.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-time-stop-in-a-black-hole></span>Does time stop in a black hole?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Near a black hole, the slowing of time is extreme. From <b>the viewpoint of an observer outside the black hole, time stops</b>. … Inside the black hole, the flow of time itself draws falling objects into the center of the black hole. No force in the universe can stop this fall, any more than we can stop the flow of time.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-a-wormhole-exist></span>Can a wormhole exist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the early days of research on black holes, before they even had that name, physicists did not yet know if these bizarre objects existed in the real world. The original idea of a wormhole came from physicists Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen. …<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-do-astronauts-get-paid></span>How much do astronauts get paid?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The pay grades for civilian astronauts are GS-11 through GS-14, based on academic achievements and experience. Currently, a GS-11 astronaut starts <b>at $64,724 per year</b>; a GS-14 astronaut can earn up to $141,715 in annual salary [source: NASA].<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-white-black-hole></span>What is a white black hole?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Schwarzschild wormhole<p>A white hole is <b>a black hole running backwards in time</b>. Just as black holes swallow things irretrievably, so also do white holes spit them out. White holes cannot exist, since they violate the second law of thermodynamics.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-time-really-exist></span>Does time really exist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Time is a prime conflict between relativity and quantum mechanics, measured and malleable in relativity while assumed as background (and not an observable) in quantum mechanics. To many physicists, while we experience time as psychologically real, <b>time is not fundamentally real</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-nearest-black-hole-to-earth></span>What is the nearest black hole to Earth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>For a comparison, <b>Sagittarius A</b>, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, is thought to be about 4 million times the mass of the sun. In addition to being among the smallest black holes ever seen, it’s the nearest one to us that we know of, at just 1,500 light years away.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-time-travelling-possible></span>Is time Travelling possible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In Summary: Yes, <b>time travel is indeed a real thing</b>. But it’s not quite what you’ve probably seen in the movies. Under certain conditions, it is possible to experience time passing at a different rate than 1 second per second.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-black-holes-stretch-you></span>Do black holes stretch you?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the most extreme cases, near black holes, <b>the stretching is so powerful that no object can withstand it</b>, no matter how strong its components. … If one were to fall into a black hole feet first, the gravity at their feet would be much stronger than at their head, causing the person to be vertically stretched.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-inside-a-black-hole></span>What is inside a black hole?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>At the center of a black hole, it is often postulated there is something called <b>a gravitational singularity</b>, or singularity. This is where gravity and density are infinite and space-time extends into infinity. Just what the physics is like at this point in the black hole no-one can say for sure.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-black-hole-is-formed></span>How black hole is formed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>How Do Black Holes Form? Primordial black holes are thought to have formed in the early universe, soon after the big bang. Stellar black holes form <b>when the center of a very massive star collapses in upon itself</b>. This collapse also causes a supernova, or an exploding star, that blasts part of the star into space.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46iqmasmJq%2FpnnAZqSiqqKkv27BzaKtnqqjmnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jack-carden-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-597579-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jack Carden Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
