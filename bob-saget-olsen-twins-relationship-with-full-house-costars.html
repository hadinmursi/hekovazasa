The epitome of a family-friendly sitcom, each episode ended with the show’s popular characters learning a lesson that wrapped things up nicely. As a result, fans quickly came to love the series’ stars which is why fans still want to know what happened to Full House’s cast after the series ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>22 Things That Make No Sense About Full (And Fuller) House</a></span></p><p>Of course, no matter how innocent Full House was, it isn’t overly surprising that the show’s stars weren’t family-friendly all of the time when the cameras were off. Still, many fans were surprised to learn <a href=#>how inappropriate Full House’s adult stars could be behind the scenes</a>. Even with that in mind, however, a joke that John Stamos once made about Bob Saget and Mary-Kate Olsen was truly shocking, to say the least.</p><h2 id=john-stamos-rsquo-shocking-joke-about-bob-saget-and-mary-kate-olsen>John Stamos’ Shocking Joke About Bob Saget And Mary-Kate Olsen</h2><p>When Bob Saget rose to fame, his image seemed incredibly squeaky clean at first. After all, on top of starring in arguably the most innocent sitcom on television, Full House, Saget also hosted America's Funniest Home Videos. During each episode of America's Funniest Home Videos, Saget made a series of silly faces and put on ridiculous voices as he narrated the amusing clips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to his television persona, many fans were completely shocked when they learned <a href=#>how raunchy Bob Saget’s standup comedy was</a>. Since it had become common knowledge that Saget had a dark and perverse sense of humor, however, it made sense when it was announced that he was going to be the subject of a comedy roast. Even though every Comedy Central Roast features over-the-top remarks, Saget’s roast featured some extremely disturbing jokes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Jonas Brothers Family Roast’ On Netflix: The Biggest Reveals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During The Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget, several notable stars cracked jokes at the sitcom star’s expense and everyone else on stage. For example, Brian Posehn, Gilbert Gottfried, Jon Lovitz, Norm Macdonald, Cloris Leachman, and Jeff Ross all took to the stage to garner laughs. Amazingly enough, some of the comedians cracked jokes that implied that Saget had an inappropriate relationship with Mary-Kate Olsen including Posehn and Ross. Given the nature of those jokes, there is no way they could be quoted here.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This One Joke Was Off-Limits At The Comedy Central Roast Of Donald Trump</a></span></p><p>Even though it was amazing to see Brian Posehn and Jeff Ross cracking jokes about Bob Saget taking advantage of Mary-Kate Olsen, they both have a history of making off-color remarks for laughs. On the other hand, John Stamos has never been a comedian and he has always presented himself as a straight-laced star. On top of that, Stamos has known the Olsen Twins since they were in diapers. Still, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stamos also cracked a joke about Saget taking advantage of Mary-Kate</a> which was truly shocking to see. In fact, Stamos’ joke was so extreme that it also can’t be quoted here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-olsen-twins-relationship-with-their-full-house-co-stars>The Olsen Twins Relationship With Their Full House Co-Stars</h2><p>When Full House was at the height of its popularity, everyone knew that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were the show’s most popular stars. As a result of that, once Full House came to an end, the <a href=#>Olsen Twins were able to become extremely wealthy</a> after building a brand that marketed things to their millions of fans. After attaining all of that success, however, the Olsen twins notably pulled back from the spotlight and now it is widely believed that they hate being famous.</p><p>Given the fact that they have been under the harsh spotlight of the press all of their lives, most people assume that the tabloids are the only reason why Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen hate fame. However, some people have concluded that the Olsen twins have another reason to loathe fame. After all, at times it has seemed like there might be tensions between the Olsens and their former Full House co-stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Full House was revived for the sequel series Fuller House, almost everyone who starred in the original series returned to their roles. However, throughout Fuller House’s five-season run, the Olsen twins never made an appearance. Instead, the only way that the Olsen twins were a part of Fuller House is the show occasionally made thinly veiled references to their refusal to return to their roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that many Full House fans wanted to see the Olsen Twins reunite with their former Full House co-stars, it makes sense that they read a lot into Fuller House’s references to the sisters. However, there are many, many examples of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuller House’s stars defending the Olsens’ decision to not take part in the revival</a>. On top of that, the Olsens’ former childhood co-stars have expressed their love for the duo and when Bob Saget passed away, Mary-Kate and Ashley made it clear they mourned his demise. With all of that in mind, it seems clear that while the Olsens seem to hate fame, they love their former Full House co-stars.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s Why Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen Hate Being Famous</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZqJpdqK6osdNmpqWrlaN6tcPIp6pmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmna6knGK1sMHSnmScp6OprrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./julie-chen-shares-makeup-free-post-video-watch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julie Chen Shares Makeup-Free Post, Video: Watch">&larr;
