"And I couldn't be happier."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another friend said that "Downey's road to sobriety was a rocky one," and that many people abandoned him at his worst. "<strong>Not a lot of people stood by his side, it was a very small group, that's just the reality. It was a couple of dear friends. They love to put you up at the top to knock the s**t out of you and watch you crawl back up and give you a nice little entryway to get back in and a path to redemption.</strong>"</p><h2 id=robert-credits-his-wife-for-this-drastic-change>Robert Credits His Wife For This Drastic Change</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/robert-downey-jr-and-wife-susan-downey.jpg><p>Robert Downey Jr. met his wife Susan Levin at a very delicate moment in his life. After his stint in prison, Robert was struggling to reinsert himself into showbusiness. <strong>When he finally landed a role in the movie Gothika in 2003, one of the producers was none other than Susan Levin. The pair quietly started dating while making the movie, and in 2005 they married.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They have collaborated in many movies together since Gothika, and together they founded their production company, Team Downey. <strong>In every acceptance speech, <a href=#>he makes sure to highlight how crucial she was in his process of turning his life around</a>.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-13t115511-146.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Asking Robert Downey Jr. About His Past During An Interview Is Not A Good Idea">Asking Robert Downey Jr. About His Past During An Interview Is Not A Good Idea</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Robert Downey Jr. took exception to one interviewer's line of questioning, as he kept pressing the actor about his past.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan gave him an ultimatum about getting serious about his sobriety</a>. Apparently, he had a short slip-up after they finished their movie. <strong>"I did meet Darth Vader, for like a minute, right after the movie wrapped, and I said immediately, 'This isn't gonna work.' I made it clear that to stay with me, nothing could happen."</strong></p><p>Robert was committed to her, and to getting better, and will forever be grateful for her support.
