Instances like that are rare, but as we have seen in the past, it can totally happen. The Beverly Hills Cop franchise, for instance, is a perfect example of a major comedy franchise that even turned its lead, <a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a>, into a major star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Will Ferrell</a> used his time on SNL to become a popular name in comedy, but once he transitioned to the big screen, the man was simply unstoppable. He has a number of famous films to his name, and <a href=#>Anchorman</a> remains one of his biggest and best to date.</p><p>Ferrell made bank from this hit, but just how much did he pocket for it? Let's take a look and see.</p><h2 id=will-ferrell-is-a-massive-star>Will Ferrell Is A Massive Star</h2><p>Prior to being cast on Saturday Night Live during the 90s, Will Ferrell had relatively little experience in front of the camera. This, however, would change in a hurry once he started showing what he could do on Saturday Night Live. The show introduced him to major audiences, and in no time, he began to land smaller roles in films that would eventually help turn him into a bankable star at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of Ferrell's earlier projects include Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Grace Under Fire, Living Single, and Men Seeking Women. 1998, however, marked a major shift for the actor, as he took the lead in A Night at the Roxbury alongside fellow SNL cast mate Chris Kattan for a cult classic. Suddenly, Ferrell had some momentum going in his favor, and things would only get better from there.</p><p>As the 90s ended and the 2000s got underway, Ferrell really started to blow up. Projects like Superstar, Zoolander, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Old School, and Elf all changed the game for the performer, and he would continue his ascent through the 2000s and beyond.</p><p>Some of the actors other hits include Wedding Crashers, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys. Ferrell's body of comedy works is impressive, and to date, Anchorman remains one of his best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The True Origin Of Will Ferrell's Cult-Classic 'Old School'</a></span></p><h2 id=39-anchorman-39-was-a-hit-that-turned-into-a-small-franchise>'Anchorman' Was A Hit That Turned Into A Small Franchise</h2><p>In 2004, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy hit theaters and gave Ferrell a starring vehicle to really showcase his comedic abilities. By this point, the ball was already rolling on his mainstream success, and this quotable comedy hit wound up becoming a fan favorite that is still loved by many.</p><p>Aside from Ferrell starring in the flick, the movie also features outstanding performers like Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughn, Steve Carell, Ben Stiller, and Christina Applegate. Lest we forget that the insanely talented Kathryn Hahn is even in this movie. Yeah, the cast is loaded here, and with a sharp script from Ferrell and Adam McKay, it is easy to see why this movie became such a success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>9 years later, in 2013, Anchorman2: The Legend Continues was released, and while it was not as loved as the first installment, the film was still a financial success at the box office.</p><p>Aside from the sequel, Ferrell has also portrayed the character on sports shows, and he even did Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie, which was a direct-to-video release that was bundled with the DVD for Anchorman. The iconic character even has his own podcast these days.</p><p>The success of playing Ron Burgundy certainly has people wondering how much Ferrell made to play the character.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Will Ferrell And Luke Wilson Were Originally Rejected In 'Old School'</a></span></p><h2 id=ferrell-was-paid-7-million-for-39-anchorman-39>Ferrell Was Paid $7 Million For 'Anchorman'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Inspiration Feed, Will Ferrell was paid a solid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$7 million</a> to play Ron Burgundy for the very first time. Considering that he had found success already, it makes sense that he would have been tracking near the $10 million mark. Of course, as time went on, Ferrell would start to command the big bucks for his work on the big screen.</p><p>An interesting thing to note here is that Ferrell made a ton more money than an actual anchorman would for their work on television. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, Ferrell's $7 million towers over the $64,600 salary that a real anchorman would be pulling down. As cool as it must have been for these anchormen to see a movie about their profession, it had to sting a little bit knowing that they will never come remotely close to matching what Ferrell did for his fictional portrayal of their job.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Has The Higher Net Worth: Will Ferrell Or John C.
