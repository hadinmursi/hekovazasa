He then starred in Schumacher’s psychological thriller Phone Booth where he plays a hostage in a New York City phone booth. He also appeared in the American thrillers S.W.A.T. and The Recruit and as the villain Bullseye in the 2003 superhero film, Daredevil starring Ben Affleck in the titular role.</p><p>The year 2006 saw Colin Farrell in the action comedy-drama, Miami Vice, opposite Jamie Foxx. He bagged a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his performance in In Bruges in 2008. Farrell starred in the black comedy film Horrible Bosses (2011), for which he received critical praise, along with the comedy-horror film Fright Night (2011) and the sci-fi action film Total Recall (2012). Farrell subsequently starred as a criminal in the highest-earning Irish independent classic, Intermission, before switching to historical epics with his second venture being the Oscar-nominated The New World.

Dumbo is based upon a storyline written by Helen Aberson and is a full-length adaptation of Walt Disney’s 1941 animated film of the same name written by Otto Englander, Joe Grant, and Dick Huemer. Ehren Kruger adapted the screenplay into this modern version. The film stars Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, and Alan Arkin, with child stars Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins, and Edd Osmond as the titular character.</p><p>The story follows a family that works at a failing traveling circus as they encounter a baby elephant with extremely large ears who is capable of flying. Dumbo was released to theaters on March 29, 2019. It nabbed the top spot at the USA box office and collected $45 million from 4,259 venues, falling short of expectations that anticipated a launch estimate of $50 million. Overseas, Dumbo got off to a better start, earning $71 million for a global launch weekend haul of $116 million. Walt Disney Studios shelled out $170 million to produce Dumbo, not including marketing and distribution fees.</p><p>Dumbo grossed $114.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $238.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $353 million, against a production budget of $170 million. It was estimated that the film would have had to gross more than $500 million worldwide to break even.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=colin-farrell-net-worth-since-he-played-holt-in-%e2%80%98dumbo></span><strong>Colin Farrell Net Worth Since He Played Holt In ‘Dumbo’</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Colin Farrell has had a colorful acting career filled with movies of different genres.
