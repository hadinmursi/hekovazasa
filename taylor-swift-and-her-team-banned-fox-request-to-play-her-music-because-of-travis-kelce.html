However, with the association of Travis Kelce, networks are trying to capitalize as best they can. Though Taylor Swift's team isn't willing to profit, or go along with this tactic. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift's team banned Fox from playing her music during Travis Kelce's NFL game</a>.</p><p>A producer for the network claims a pitch was made prior to a Chiefs game, but Swift and her team had strict rules about playing her music around Travis Kelce's career.</p><p>The Independent reveals, "Writing on the Fox Sports blog, lead producer Richie Zyontz explained that the team had heard rumours about the potential relationship earlier in the week and had subsequently “sought permission to use some of Swift’s music” in their broadcast."</p><p>"Not a chance,” Zyontz wrote. “Per the Fox music department, Swift’s record label and publishing company denied our request ‘in conjunction with speculations on or about her private/personal/dating life’.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Completely Disagree With A 'Rule' Taylor Swift Enforces On Her Closest Celeb Friends</a></span></p><p>Swift's team was contacted for a statement regarding the matter but did not issue a response.

According to CBS News, the venue banned them, and this did not sit well with the fans. According to the arena policy, it was viewed as a danger as fans could throw bracelets on stage.

The venue has also prohibited tailgating. But Crook says either issue has been problematic at the tour thus far, and therefor shouldn't be restricted in Santa Clara."</p><p>"In a statement Friday, Levi's Stadium reversed the policy and said it will allow friendship bracelets into the venue, adding they "are enchanted to see you one week from today."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Private Jet Usage Has Been The Source Of Backlash And Conspiracy Theories</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it seems like one ban in particular stayed in place, and it is unlike the atmosphere of an NFL game. Tailgating was forbidden before Swift's concert.</p><p>"The venue, however, is standing firm on its no tailgating policy for both nights of the Eras tour but it comes with concern among concert goers who plan to be at the venue for about eight hours total. Many fans have made a habit of gathering around 3pm, three hours before the start of the opening act, while Taylor Swift's set is projected to end around 11pm."</p><p>This proved to be a minor issue for Swift and her team, as they had dealt with other difficulties in the past.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-also-had-issues-with-her-label-blocking-certain-performances>Taylor Swift Also Had Issues With Her Label Blocking Certain Performances</h2><p>Taylor Swift has faced other bans throughout her career. This particular ban was unclear, according to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift's label was blocking her from playing certain songs</a>.
