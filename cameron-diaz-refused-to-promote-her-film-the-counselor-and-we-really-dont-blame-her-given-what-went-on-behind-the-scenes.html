Diaz is a name synonymous with Hollywood success, as evidenced by an impressive track record that positions her as one of the industry's most successful and bankable stars. Some of her most groundbreaking achievements include a <a href=# rel=nofollow>legendary deal that saw her earnings skyrocket from $1 million to a staggering $40 million</a> for her role in Bad Teacher.</p><p>The actress' financial acumen was also on full display with her involvement in <a href=# rel=nofollow>Shrek 2, where she reportedly earned an astonishing $1 million per hour</a>. As of January 2024, Diaz's estimated net worth stands at a remarkable $140 million. This figure is even more impressive considering <a href=# rel=nofollow>she actually took an eight-year hiatus from acting</a> between 2014 and 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This established level of financial security likely played a crucial role in Diaz's decision to step back from promoting The Counselor, without fearing significant career repercussions. The same could also be said of the challenges she faced in making the film.</p><h2 id=why-cameron-diaz-refused-to-promote-the-counselor>Why Cameron Diaz Refused To Promote The Counselor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-counselor-poster.jpg><p>While Cameron Diaz never explicitly stated her refusal to promote The Counselor, her absence from promotional activities appeared to speak volumes. The Ridley Scott-directed film told the story of a Texas lawyer, portrayed by Michael Fassbender, who gets entangled in a drug deal due to financial desperation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside Fassbender's character, who is engaged to Laura (Penélope Cruz), <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a> featured as the middleman Westray, Javier Bardem as the shady nightclub owner Reiner, and Diaz herself as Malkina, Reiner's sociopathic lover.</p><p>The crux of the award-winning actress’ apparent reluctance to engage in the film's promotion, however, is said to have stemmed from a significant issue with her character's portrayal. Initially, Diaz delivered her performance as Malkina with a strong Bajan accent, reportedly reminiscent of <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cameron-diaz-made-a-fortune-from-unproven-allegations-and-scandals-while-dating-justin-timberlake.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cameron Diaz Made A Fortune From Unproven Allegations And Scandals While Dating Justin Timberlake">Cameron Diaz Made A Fortune From Unproven Allegations And Scandals While Dating Justin Timberlake</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>During Cameron Diaz's forgotten relationship with Justin Timberlake, she cashed in on a pair of scandals that she was the victim of.</p><p>This outcome did not sit well with the executives at Fox, though. According to The Hollywood Reporter, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Diaz was compelled to redub all her lines</a>, stripping her character of the original accent. This demand to essentially alter her entire performance was received with less than enthusiasm by the actor, who later refused to do any promotional work for the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-also-performed-an-infamous-scene-in-the-counselor>Cameron Diaz Also Performed An Infamous Scene In The Counselor</h2><p>Redubbing her entire script was not Cameron Diaz's only misfortune in the movie The Counselor. The accomplished star is now also infamous for performing an X-rated scene that has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">described as going “way too far.”</a> In this controversial scene, Diaz's character, Malkina, is shown straddling a Ferrari in an erotic manner.</p><p>The perspective of the scene is through the eyes of Javier Bardem's Reiner, who narrates the events to Michael Fassbender's character. This particular scene quickly became a topic of discussion among fans and critics alike, primarily for its shock value. The scene's inclusion in the film left many puzzled about its purpose and relevance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cameron-diaz-feared-a-scene-with-ben-stiller-in-there-s-something-about-mary-would-ruin-her-career.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cameron Diaz Feared A Scene With Ben Stiller In There's Something About Mary Would Ruin Her Career">Cameron Diaz Feared A Scene With Ben Stiller In There's Something About Mary Would Ruin Her Career</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Cameron Diaz almost said "no" to a very iconic scene in There's Something About Mary.</p><p>One comment on YouTube reflected this confusion: "I have never been sure why this scene was even in the movie other than to make me laugh uncontrollably. It's not really very sexy and Javier’s facial expressions are priceless. And I can only imagine how uncomfortable Cameron Diaz was with doing this scene. Sometimes I think these filmmakers put these scenes in films just to see actresses humiliated."</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz-rsquo-s-the-counselor-was-a-critical-failure>Cameron Diaz’s The Counselor Was A Critical Failure</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Cameron Diaz’s The Counselor was not just a personal disappointment for the star, but it also turned out to be a critical and commercial failure. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The film's performance at the box office was underwhelming</a>, despite grossing a sum of $71 million against a production budget of $25 million. The project essentially failed to generate the expected interest or revenue despite the star-studded cast and the renowned director behind it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=the-counselor-commercial-performance-per-the-numbers>The Counselor Commercial Performance (per The Numbers)</h3><table border=3 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Metric</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Amount</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Production Budget</p></td><td><p>$25,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Domestic Box Office</p></td><td><p>$16,973,715</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>International Box Office</p></td><td><p>$54,035,619</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Estimated Domestic Video Sales</p></td><td><p>$7,169,433</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Worldwide Box Office</p></td><td><p>$71,009,334</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This lackluster performance was mirrored in its critical reception, which was overwhelmingly negative. Critics were particularly harsh in their assessments, with some describing the film as confusing and out of place. One review likened watching The Counselor to "watching a movie in another language," while another compared it to "watching a group of decent, polite people trying to cope with the arrival of a certifiable lunatic to their hitherto civilised party."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further criticism noted the motion picture's lack of subtlety and inventiveness. This lack of creativity would have been a significant letdown, considering the caliber of talent involved in both the making of the film.</p><p>Fans echoed these sentiments, expressing their disappointment in no uncertain terms. One fan remarked, "Considering the amount of talent working together here both in front and behind the camera, this has to be one of the most catastrophic misfires of all times." Another bluntly referred to The Counselor as "inept and boring melodramatic waffle."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqWVp7yvecOimLNlopqztr%2FEnWStp12lv7C5zq2cZqCVp3qntcumZK2glWKwsMHNrJylp6Jirq%2BwjLCcZqqVlrmtxYydpqesXZe5ornEZp%2Beql2ctrexzWauoZmkYsSmutNmpqdlkpq1qrrDZquhnV2osKa6xKxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charlotte-running-host-2027-army-navy-game.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlotte not chosen to host Army-Navy game  WSOC TV">&larr;
