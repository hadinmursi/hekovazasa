Monie Love and her husband Tuff has 4 children together.</p><p>Monie real name is Simone Johnson/Gooden, despite the fact that Monie Love is her stage name. Rapper and actress Monie is a native of London. By that point, she was working as a radio host. Love works for the station Urban Adult Contemporary.</p><p>Tuff, on the other hand, is a vocalist like his wife Monie. Jamaican songs with native styles that incorporate elements of rock and soul music are sung by Groove. These songs are also known as reggae.</p><p>Tuff, was a part of the African band The African Brothers in the 1960s and 1970s before starting his career as a solo artist.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Who was Monie Love married to?">Who was Monie Love married to?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Monie Love And Tony Tuff In Marriage Boot Camp : Hip Hop Edition">Monie Love And Tony Tuff In Marriage Boot Camp : Hip Hop Edition</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Was Monie Physically And Mentally Abused By Tuff?">Was Monie Physically And Mentally Abused By Tuff?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Did Tuff Really Cheated On Monie?">Did Tuff Really Cheated On Monie?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="What Happened To Monie Love And Husband Tuff?">What Happened To Monie Love And Husband Tuff?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-was-monie-love-married-to></span>Who was Monie Love married to?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Monie Love married Tony Tuff a Jamaican singer in 2008. Love and Tuff both share the same profession.</p><p>Despite being a singer and songwriter like his wife Love, Tuff has not amassed as much fame. For more than fifteen years, Tuff and Love have been a couple. Tuff has revealed that there is a close to twelve-year age difference between the couple.</p><p>Love always assumed that the first time she met Tuff would be all about having fun with a boy and that the memory would eventually pass. She turned out to be wrong, and the pair remained together for a long time.</p><p>Tuff has dedicated a lot of time to his career, yet he still finds it difficult to advance. In his musical endeavors, he has failed.&nbsp;Information about him is still in a nutshell because, unlike his wife Monie, he is not very active on social media.</p><p>Monie, on the other hand, is a popular singer who was born in England. She has two brothers, Richard and David Gooden, and a sister, Rosanna Sharian Gooden, who is also a singer. Her father was a jazz musician.</p><p>Monie relocated to New York City where she later met her boyfriend. She has been married twice and has four children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=monie-love-and-tony-tuff-in-marriage-boot-camp-hip-hop-edition></span>Monie Love And Tony Tuff In Marriage Boot Camp : Hip Hop Edition<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Monie Love and Tony Tuff began their love journey so well that and ended up getting married. Their long lasting love began to fade slowly.</p><p>Even though they began dating at the beginning of 20s and got married in 2008, When Monie and Tuff later decided to attend “Marriage Boot Camp” to work on their marital problems in 2021, many of their followers were astonished because they had always believed that the couple’s relationship was going well.</p><p>The couple opened out about how their blissful relationship abruptly altered after Tuff started cheating on Monie, and how they made the decision to attend Marriage Boot Camp, an American television program designed specifically to test the limits of reality star couples.</p><p>Everything altered because the majority of their admirers first became aware of their negative traits after they made an appearance on a show.</p><p>Monie spoke loudly about all the challenges she had faced while dating Tuff as the two discussed what had happened in the same room on the show.</p><p>Even after he took Monie over, Tuff always felt like she would need to assist him. Tony’s idea confused Monie, who felt frozen. Love discovered that Tuff holds her responsible for his failure to succeed in his rap career.</p><p>Monie offended Tuff by allowing his actions to influence how they generated money. Monie asked him if she shouldn’t have put the brakes on assisting him professionally after going through what she did as a woman in a relationship and Tuff trashing her. Monie thought poorly of what Tuff said to her. To which Tuff responded: There are times when individuals don’t reject them due to an act of infidelity that occurred.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-monie-physically-and-mentally-abused-by-tuff></span>Was Monie Physically And Mentally Abused By Tuff?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Monie in an episode of Marriage Boot Camp revealed that she was physically and mentally abused. Love wanted the public to know about her pain.</p><p>Love claimed that everyone who knows her just sees one side of her without understanding the other. Everyone has always known how resilient Monie has been throughout her life. She wished for everyone to be aware of its vulnerability. She also believed that because she doesn’t display her pain, others won’t understand her. Monie has consistently moved forward like a train.</p><p>Monie received three years of maltreatment, which she never deserved. She was abused by Tuff?</p><p>No, it wasn’t Tuff; she had experienced violence in a previous relationship. Although Monie never publicly disclosed it, she openly expressed it while appearing on the television program Marriage Boot Camp. She told her husband Tuff about it. Tuff also failed to honor her by adding up all of it and ruining everything.</p><p>Although Tuff didn’t physically harm Monie, the things he added affected her mentally.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-tuff-really-cheated-on-monie></span>Did Tuff Really Cheated On Monie?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Monie and Tuff went to fix their relationship in Marriage Boot Camp with four other couples. Everyone knew that Tuff cheated on his wife.</p><p>Tuff was asked by Monie if he would continue his relationship with her after having cheated on her. Tuff responded that he would undoubtedly do so because, as he pointed out, neither his grandmother nor his mother left their grandfather after being cheated on.</p><p>In the perspective of the public, he was like a dealbreaker who continued his family’s heritage. Tuff was attempting to demonstrate how men used to take care of everything, believing that as long as he took care of his home, everything he did was on him.</p><p>Tuff said that he learned those skills from his forefathers and that’s how he grew up. He also acknowledged that he hails from a culture where cheating is not taken seriously.</p><p>While Monie has no other option because cheating is a clear deal-breaker.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-monie-love-and-husband-tuff></span>What Happened To Monie Love And Husband Tuff?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tuff has been dating the two times Grammy nominated rapper and composer Monie for thirteen years. But after decade the couple was in real jeopardy.</p><p>The British rapper is at her wits’ end as a result of Tuff’s persistent adultery, which has ruined the relationship. It could be simpler to forgive a single cheat than to insist that your partner make sure it never happens again. But for Monie, infidelity remained a recurring theme in their relationship to the point where it was absurd.</p><p>During an interview with the morning club, Monie frankly acknowledged that Tuff cheated on her while she was pregnant. The couple lives in different states and has been alienated.</p><p>Given that they live far apart and since cheating is such a significant problem in their relationship, it is unclear how trust may be restored or established.</p><p>Despite the fact that they are not physically attached to each other, Tuff and Monie have managed to stay in each other’s life mostly because they want to be a part of each other’s lives and because they love and have a child together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmpKimmZp6rbvVnmSmmaKntqawjK2maA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wwe-nxt-gold-rush-results.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE NXT Gold Rush Results">&larr;
