Every year, tons of people audition and cross their fingers that they will win... and maybe get the opportunity to record an album (or five). Megan Danielle is no stranger to these types of shows. In fact, she was cast in The Voice season 18, but she didn't end up winning. She came much closer to reality TV victory when she was the runner-up in season 21 of American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Megan Danielle didn't win American Idol 2023 and that honor went to Iam Tongi, she still got very far and should be super proud of her accomplishments. But how does Megan Danielle really feel about her time on American Idol? Does she think that the competition series has given her a leg up and helped her stand out in the crowded music industry?</p><h2 id=what-was-megan-danielle-39-s-american-idol-2023-experience-like>What Was Megan Danielle's American Idol 2023 Experience Like?</h2><p><a href=#>American Idol auditions have to be memorable</a>. That sometimes means that they are super dramatic or feature a performer who has a memorable voice that stops everyone in their tracks.</p><p>Megan Danielle has a moving and unforgettable background, and that likely enabled her to move forward during the audition process. According to Music Mayhem Magazine, she explained that she became a fan of music because of her close relationship with her grandfather, Chuck Bass. Every time Danielle talked about her relative, she tugged on people's heartstrings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/megan-danielle.jpg><p>Music Mayhem Magazine mentioned that when Danielle performed the song "You Say" by Lauren Daigle during her American Idol audition, Daigle performed alongside her. Daigle said, “Your story reminds me of my own so much, with your Grandfather. I want to hear what [the Idol judges] have to say.”</p><p>Danielle explained that her grandfather encouraged her to sing faith-based music, which is where she feels that she belongs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Lionel Richie Really Feel About American Idol And If He's Actually Friends With The Other Judges?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer had a great time on American Idol and stayed positive even though she was the runner-up. She told The New York Post that she supported the winner Iam Tongi. She said, “Even if I was first, second, last, whatever … I feel like any of us really deserved it.”</p><p>The best American Idol contestants pick memorable songs, and that's exactly what Danielle did. She sang Bonnie Raitt's "Angel From Montgomery" when she made it into the top 12. Before that, she picked Lady Gaga's "Always Remember Us This Way" and Patty Griffin's "Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/megan-danielle-singing.jpg><p>In the final episode of American Idol's 2023 season, Danielle performed an original song called "Dream Girl" along with Journey's "Faithfully" and Keith Urban's "God Whispered Your Name."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-american-idol-2023-contestant-megan-danielle-39-s-music-career-like-now>What Is American Idol 2023 Contestant Megan Danielle's Music Career Like Now?</h2><p>It seems like appearing on American Idol 2023 has only helped Megan Danielle. For one thing, she has become an online presence, and she has 146,000 Instagram followers. Now people are more familiar with her name and what she's all about, which can only help her in the future. She also has many videos on her website of her American Idol performances. These serve as important reminders of how talented she is.</p><p>In an interview with TV Insider, Megan Danielle talked about American Idol and said that she wants to record an album. Even though she was the runner-up and not the winner, she isn't letting that stand in her way. She definitely still wants to achieve this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/megan-danielle-singing-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer said, "I want to finish my Christian album. I want to tour everywhere. I always wanted to start my own church." She is definitely hard at work on that goal. On June 13th 2023, she posted a video on Instagram and said "New tunes coming sooooon."</p><p>Danielle also told TV Insider that the reality series helped her nail down her identity and become a more self-assured performer. She said, "I see myself as a country and Christian artist, but I don’t want to label myself as one thing. I love both. I want to find a way to make it all work." She also explained, "I think all of them and the judges have told me to find out who I am and work on building up that confidence."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Being The "Meanest" Judge, Simon Cowell Burst Into Tears After Seeing These Performances On American Idol And America's Got Talent</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Danielle's website, she is currently part of Maddie Poppe's summer 2023 tour. There are several tour dates throughout the United States in July and August 2023.

Really, you can listen to Dream Girl anywhere, literally anywhere in the gym, in the car, when you’re sleeping, who cares? It’s, it’s such a positive song that I feel like anybody can rock out to it and just love it.”</p><p>She continued to Country Now, “To be able to record my own song is honestly amazing. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do, which is just lead people in the right direction and touch their heart with my music.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/megan-danielle-levi-walker.jpg><p>Many American Idol 2023 viewers connected with Megan Danielle and look forward to the music that she is going to release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Redditor @GeorgeCasey9 started a thread called "Megan Danielle has the best chance of a career of the 3" final contestants. They wrote that she is "the most marketable winner."</p><p>It's true that sometimes, American Idol winners and contestants don't have the type of careers that they hoped to have as a result of the hit show. But it seems that Megan Danielle was glad to get her chance to compete on the show. She definitely became more famous in the process. Now that she's going on tour in the summer of 2023 and working on an album, it seems that Megan Danielle is very glad that she competed on American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdl7KqusZmmKadop6worqMopuopF1nfXN%2FjKusp6aVp3q2vIyhnKWoXaS%2FbrTUq6tmpZWcrq95w5qlop2cobK0ecyuqqKbXZius7HEq2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./elizabeth-alvarez-kusi-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-instagram-salary-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elizabeth Alvarez KUSI: Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband, Instagram, Salary and Net Worth">&larr;
