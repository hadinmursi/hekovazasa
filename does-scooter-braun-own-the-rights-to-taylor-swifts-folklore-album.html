Or when his client, Kanye West, organized a revenge porn music video which strips my body naked.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly upset by the news, she vowed to re-record all of her songs and have them distributed under her new label with Universal Music Group - Braun would still own the masters of the original version though.</p><p>Braun actually has no attachment to any of Swift’s recent projects, including her seventh studio album Lover, meaning he didn’t and won’t be generating any income from sales concerning music the singer has put out since she dropped her last album.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez Expresses Love for BFF Taylor Swift’s New Album</a></span></p><p>In November 2019, the Grammy winner accused Braun of preventing her from performing her songs pre-Lover at award shows and tours, leading Swift’s fanbase to intervene by reportedly sending <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">death threats to the 39-year-old’s family</a>.</p><p>In response to the situation, Braun wrote in a statement: "I am certain there is no situation ever worth jeopardizing anyone's safety,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I assume this was not your intention but it is important that you understand that your words carry a tremendous amount of weight and that your message can be interpreted by some in different ways.”</p><p>He concluded by saying: "At this point with safety becoming a concern I have no choice other than to publicly ask for us to come together and try to find a resolution. I have tried repeatedly through your representatives to achieve a solution but unfortunately here we are. This game of telephone isn’t working."</p><h2 id=folklore-becomes-an-instant-commercial-hit>Folklore Becomes An Instant Commercial Hit</h2><p>The surprise release of Folklore has proven to not just Braun but also Swift’s fans that her popularity hasn’t declined one bit.</p><p>Though she’s been plagued by drama concerning her former record label and how she blamed them of not allowing her to make an offer on her master recordings, the Love Story hitmaker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has continued to dominate the charts</a> - and with Folklore, it was no different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Taylor Swift Song From Lover You Are, Based On Your Zodiac Sign</a></span></p><p>The good thing about the record’s success is that Braun has absolutely no involvement, meaning Swift doesn’t just own the master recordings but she’s also earning plenty of money from its stellar commercial performance.</p><p>Spotify announced that Swift’s latest project had achieved the most day-one streams of an album on its streaming service by any female artist, amassing an incredible 80.6 million streams in just 24 hours.</p><p>In the US alone, Folklore sold 846,000 copies, making her the first artist in chart history to have seven albums shifting more than 500,000 copies in its debut week while also attaining the title of being the first female singer to have seven records shoot straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift: Ranking Every Song On Folklore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYsCku86tnKtlkqeutrqMqK6nZaSdsm6%2ByKCfratdqbxuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTrGSfp5ygubC%2BxGaYpZqlonw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dwts-20-results-did-rumer-willis-riker-lynch-or-noah-galloway-win-2015195.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DWTS 20 Results: Rumer Willis Wins, Beats Riker Lynch, Noah Galloway">&larr;
