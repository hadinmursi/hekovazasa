Some of these friendships make sense, whereas others seem downright crazy.</p><p>One of these friendships that might not make as much sense is the one between <a href=#><strong>Ed Sheeran</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Katy Perry</a></strong>. Whilst they both share an interest in <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a>, they might not necessarily strike fans as two people who would be close friends, but this could have all changed after the pair shared a somewhat intimate moment together back in 2017.</p><h2 id=are-ed-sheeran-and-katy-perry-friends>Are Ed Sheeran And Katy Perry Friends?</h2><p>Whilst there have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previous reports that the pair are best friends</a>, there is also some evidence that this might not be the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ed-sheeran-katy-perry-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, ever since these reports first circulated with the pair seen hanging out together at the BRITs and Ed had gatecrashed a radio interview that Katy was doing, the pair haven't been seen together since.</p><p>There is also the issue of Instagram. Whilst a following on social media doesn't necessarily indicate that two people are friends and, in the same way, two people not following each other online doesn't necessarily mean that they're not friends, neither Katy nor Ed are following each other on Instagram.</p><p>Ed only follows his HQ account, but Katy follows many of her friends, including <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, so this may indicate that the pair aren't as close as was previously implied.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Earn And Spend Their $370 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katy-and-ed-both-share-a-bestie-in-taylor-swift>Katy And Ed Both Share A Bestie In Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/katy-perry-taylor-swift.jpg><p>Even if Katy and Ed aren't as close as what may have once been implied, one person that they do have in common is none other than Taylor Swift. The pair have both <a href=#>long been friends with Taylor</a> separately, with Ed and Taylor releasing a song together and Katy even appeared in one of Taylor's music videos.</p><p>Despite the fact that Taylor and Katy once <a href=#>had a very public feud</a>, the pair have since made up, and it could possibly be Taylor who could get both Ed and Katy to be as good friends as she is with the pair of them.</p><h2 id=katy-perry-asked-ed-sheeran-to-smell-her-armpits>Katy Perry Asked Ed Sheeran To Smell Her Armpits</h2><p>Many people will have received at least one weird request from someone else at some point in their lives, but more often than not it is likely to come from someone they are quite close to as opposed to someone they hardly know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This didn't seem to be the case for Katy and Ed. Whilst it's not exactly clear whether this was the very first time they had met, Ed received a very weird request from Katy that might have been enough to scare anyone off, which was to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">smell her armpits</a>.</p><p>If they hadn't met before then, Katy asking Ed to smell her armpits certainly would have created a bond between the pair that would be impossible to replicate with anyone else.</p><p>They started off by bonding over the Grammys and how, despite them both having multiple nominations, they both always seem to <a href=#>lose out to other people</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Breaking Down Ed Sheeran's Reported $200 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>While some might think that this alone would be enough for the pair to bond over, Katy decided to take it one step further. When Ed complained about losing out every year, Katy said, "It's all right. I've lost thirteen. Smell my armpit."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as consolation prizes go, this is certainly one of the more unusual to be offered. Where Katy and Ed aren't known for being that close to this day, it's unknown whether it was Katy asking Ed to smell her armpit that put him off, or whether their personalities didn't quite match up.</p><p>It's more than likely that these days they are just friendly music rivals who might see each other at some awards shows or from mixing with mutual friends (such as Taylor Swift) and who are aiming to get that top spot in the charts.</p><h2 id=prince-wasn-39-t-a-fan-of-ed-or-katy>Prince Wasn't A Fan Of Ed Or Katy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar45957541-1.jpg><p>Despite the pair not being friends but having the armpit story to forever bond them, another thing they also have in common is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince wasn't a fan of either of them</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prince had co-written a memoir before his death with Dan Piepenbring and as a part of working on this memoir, Prince had written a note about his feelings on modern-day pop music.</p><p>In this note, Prince had made it more than clear that he didn't like modern pop music, in particular calling out the likes of Ed and Katy, saying "we need to tell them that they keep trying to ram Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran down our throats, and we don't like it no matter how many times they play it."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Katy Perry Once Sued A Magazine Over Rumors She Cheated On Her Husband</a></span></p><p>This is, of course, down to a matter of opinion as not everyone is going to like the same music. For example, Ed was able to break records by <a href=#>selling a million tickets</a> for his 2018 tour and Katy has been able to <a href=#>top the Billboard charts on multiple occasions</a>, so clearly not everyone agrees with Prince's statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecqaq7JloJq%2Fs8WMmqWdZZWZerS0xJ6pmqZdl7Kku8yeZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kerry-washington-passionately-refutes-marriage-trouble-rumors-w167106.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kerry Washington Addresses Nnamdi Asomugha Marriage Trouble Rumors">&larr;
