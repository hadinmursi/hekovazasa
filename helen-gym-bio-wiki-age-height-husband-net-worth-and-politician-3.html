Around that year, she co-founded the Parents United for Public Education. She is a member of the editorial board of Rethinking Schools and one of the founders of The Philadelphia Public School Notebook, a nonprofit, independent, free news service. She also co-founded a charter school in Chinatown called the Folk Art Cultural Treasures School.</p><p>In 2000, Gym led a campaign called the “Stadium Out of Chinatown Coalition” against the construction of a baseball stadium north of Chinatown, due to the fear that it might result in the gentrification of the area.</p><p>She has also led other campaigns. In 2008, she fought against the establishment of the proposed Foxwoods Casino planned near Philadelphia’s Chinatown because of the concern that unchecked development would compel longtime residents of that area to move away. She has also organized in opposition to state-sponsored, predatory gambling.</p><p>In 2009, she worked on a successful federal civil rights case to help stop the bullying and harassment of Asian American students in South Philadelphia High School. The case came about partially due to a series of assaults at the school on December 3, 2009, when as many as thirty Asian immigrant students were attacked and beaten by large groups of African-American students.</p><p>In her testimony, she called for the commission to require the school and district officials bear responsibility for not addressing the problem, to differentiate bias-based harassment and generalized violence, and take a different approach for each, and to develop effective anti-harassment policies and procedures. One result of the case was the 2014 creation of the AAPI Bullying Prevention Task Force. (“AAPI” stands for Asian American Pacific Islanders.)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=helen-gym-philadelphia></span><span id=Helen_Gym_Philadelphia>Helen Gym <span id=Philadelphia_City_Council class=mw-headline>Philadelphia&nbsp;</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In January 2016, Gym succeeded newly-elected Mayor Jim Kenney as a Democratic member of the Philadelphia City Council at-large district.
