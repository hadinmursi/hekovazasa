It’s been widely speculated that the “Irreplaceable” singer’s latest work is an autobiographical reference to her marriage with <b>Jay Z</b>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>The internet has accused several starlets of being “Becky,” the woman who supposedly came between the world’s most powerful couple. Here, </span><i>Us Weekly </i><span>has rounded up the most convincing (and hysterical) theories.</span></p><p><b>Rachel Roy</b></p><p>Many believed fashion designer<b> Rachel Roy</b> hinted that she was “Becky” when she posted an Instagram of herself and a few friends. “Good hair don’t care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies, or self truths, always. Live in the light #nodramaqueens,” she captioned the now-deleted pic. Since Roy spoke out, the Beyhive has accused her of having inappropriate relations with Jay Z, 46, during his eight-year marriage to Bey. (It’s long been rumored that Roy was the catalyst for <b>Solange Knowles</b>’ 2014 Met Gala elevator fight with Jay Z.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Roy, 42, has since denied those claims. “I want to put the speculation and rumors to rest. My Instagram post was meant to be fun and lighthearted, it was misunderstood as something other than that,” she said in a statement, via </span><i><a href=#>People</a></i><span>. “There is no validity to the idea that the song references me personally. There is no truth to the rumors.”</span></p><p>“Consequently, online haters have targeted me and my daughters in a hurtful and scary manner, including physical threats. As a mother — and I know many mothers would agree — I feel that bullying in any form is harmful and unacceptable,” she concluded. “I would hope that the media sees the real issue here — the issue of cyber bullying — and how it should not be tolerated by anyone.”</p><p><b>Rachael Ray</b></p><p><b>Rachael Ray</b> was caught in the crossfire of infuriated Beyoncé fans, who erroneously attacked the perky, wholesome TV chef. The <i>Rachael Ray Show</i> host was besieged by the Beyhive on social media after it was speculated that “Becky” was Roy, whose name is only a few letters off from Ray’s.</p><p>The culinary star humorously responded to the drama by sharing an idea for serving lemonade via the <i>Rachael Ray Show</i>’s official <a href=#>Instagram</a> account on April 24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Lori Loughlin</b></p><p><b>Lori Loughlin</b>, who famously played Becky Donaldson-Katsopolis on <i>Full House</i> and <i>Fuller House</i>, made <i>Lemonade</i> out of lemons by hilariously commenting on the enigmatic &nbsp;“Becky.”</p><p>On April 26, the actress, 51, posted a still from her days on <i>Full House</i> in the ’90s as “Aunt Becky,” with “Becky with the good hair” labeled across <a href=#>the photo</a>. She jokingly captioned the image, “Wasn’t me. #beckywiththegoodhair #lemonade.”</p><p><b>Rita Ora</b></p><p>On April 24, <b>Rita Ora</b> Snapchatted a picture of herself wearing lemon-inspired lingerie and a backward lowercase “R” pendant necklace that resembled a “J,” leading to more speculation that she was referring to Beyoncé’s husband, Jay Z.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Rita Ora" width=1000 height=1641 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>Almost immediately, Queen Bey’s loyal subjects branded the “I Will Never Let You Down” songstress, 25, as “Becky.” The Beyhive then inundated Ora’s Instagram page with lemon and bee emojis, the fandom’s favored form of attack on Beyoncé’s presumed enemies.</span></p><p><a href=#>Ora put the rumor to rest</a> by tweeting on April 26: “I never usually address tabloid gossip but let me be clear, these rumours are false. I have nothing but the upmost respect for Beyoncé. Let’s continue enjoying Lemonade.”</p><p><b>Gwyneth Paltrow</b></p><p>Although <b>Gwyneth Paltrow</b> is a longtime friend of Beyoncé and Jay Z’s, memes have been making their way around the Twittersphere suggesting that the blonde Oscar winner could possibly be the “Becky” with whom the hip-hop star strayed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>“They’re the greatest people,” the</span><i> Goop</i><span> founder, 43, said of the “Crazy in Love” collaborators during a January 2015 radio interview on the </span><i>Howard Stern Show</i><span>. “They are funny and sweet, and self-aware and really intelligent.”</span></p><p><b>Taylor Swift</b></p><p>In 2014, <b>Taylor Swift</b> became the subject of a much-debated Tumblr post that questioned whether an old picture of T. Swift from high school was a photo of the actual <i>1989</i> hitmaker or a girl named “Becky.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Not long after, the pop star, 26, got in on the joke and was memorably photographed wearing a T-shirt that read, “no its becky.” Of course, social-media users have created tons of new memes making the uncanny connection between Swift’s alternate moniker and the “Becky with the good hair” drama. (For the record, Beyoncé and Jay Z were among the guests at Swift’s star-studded 25th birthday bash in NYC’s Tribeca.)</span></p><p><b>Rihanna</b></p><p><b>Rihanna</b>, a rumored Jay Z conquest, has been linked to the rapper ever since she was signed to his record label at the time, Def Jam, in 2005 at just 17 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fans have suggested that Beyoncé’s girl-power anthem “Ring the Alarm,” from her sophomore 2006 solo LP, <i>B’Day,</i> is about Jay’s alleged indiscretions with the “Work” singer, 28. A sample lyric: “Ring the alarm, I been through this too long/ But I’ll be damned if I see another chick on your arm.”</p><p><b>Mya</b></p><p>At the start of the new millennium, <b>Mya</b> and Jay Z joined forces for their 2000 effort, “Best of Me (Part 2).” At the time, it was reported that the music mogul and the R&B princess, now 36, shared a romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>After it was suggested that Mya might be “Becky,” the early-aughts chart-topper told </span><a href=#><i>TMZ</i></a><span>, “I don’t have anybody coming at me. I know what I’m not guilty of.”</span></p><p>Regardless of all the varying suppositions of who “Becky” could be, Beyoncé’s unauthorized biographer, <b>J. Randy Taraborrelli </b>—&nbsp;who penned <i>Becoming Beyoncé: The Untold Story</i> — argues that <i>Lemonade</i> is an interpretation of Beyoncé’s parents’ marital strife, rather than her own.</p><p>In an April 25 interview, the author <a href=#>told Cosmopolitan.com</a> that he thinks the 20-time Grammy winner’s recent masterpiece is actually about her father, <b>Mathew Knowles</b>, cheating on her mother, <b>Tina</b>, prior to the pair’s 2011 divorce.</p><p>“Like I said earlier, I’m not a psychic, and I can’t know everything that goes on in Beyoncé’s world,” he said. “It seems to me after studying her that all of this is likely more about what she’s witnessed in her mom’s marriage.”</p><p>Beyoncé and Jay Z tied the knot in a secret ceremony on April 4, 2008. Together, they share their 4-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJ9itrR5wZ6apLFdnrtursSypqeblah6rbHMqKWanJViwKaxjJqjpWWknbJuwMeepquhlah6uH6PbWpyb18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-andreabloom2-on-tiktok-age-meet-her-on-instagram-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Andreabloom2 On TikTok?
