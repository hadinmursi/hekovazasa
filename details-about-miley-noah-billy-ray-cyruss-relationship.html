Both of his daughters are fully following his footsteps in the music industry with millions of fans who absolutely adore them. <strong><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a></strong> landed her Disney Channel role as Hannah Montana at the age of 12. <strong><a href=#>Noah Cyrus</a></strong> started releasing music down the line with her first major hit "Make Me (Cry)" being released in 2016.</p><h2 id=billy-ray-cyrus-has-never-directly-profited-off-his-daughters><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Billy Ray Cyrus Has Never Directly Profited Off His Daughters</span></h2><p>While some fans may speculate that Billy Ray Cyrus collects a portion of earnings from his famous children (especially Miley Cyrus) he denies those claims. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated in an interview</a>, "I've never made a dime off of Miley. You got a lot of people who have made percentages off of her. I'm proud to say to this day I've never made one commissioned dollar, or dime, off of my daughter." He is a celebrity in his own right and he doesn't necessarily need to profit off of his children anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noah-cyrus-had-a-hard-time-growing-up-with-her-ultra-famous-family-members><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Noah Cyrus Had A Hard Time Growing Up With Her Ultra-Famous Family Members</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper Magazine</a>, Noah Cyrus described her childhood saying, "When I was little, I wasn’t posting pictures of myself — those pictures were just on the internet because my family was my family. I read the comments about my face and things they would change about me. That made me grow to hate my face and my body. That still sticks with me." She has grown into herself and is obviously a beautiful young woman, but those horrid internet trolls did a number on her self-esteem when she was younger.</p><h2 id=billy-ray-cyrus-acknowledges-he-should-have-been-been-a-better-parent><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Billy Ray Cyrus Acknowledges He Should Have Been Been A Better Parent</span></h2><p>In his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with GQ</a>, Billy Ray Cyrus said, "I should have been a better parent. I should have said, 'Enough is enough -- it's getting dangerous and somebody's going to get hurt.' I should have, but I didn't. Honestly, I didn't know the ball was out of bounds until it was way up in the stands somewhere." He was describing the rapidly fast-paced rise to fame that Miley Cyrus experienced, which impacted their whole entire family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noah-cyrus-looks-up-to-both-miley-amp-billy-ray-cyrus><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Noah Cyrus Looks Up To Both Miley & Billy Ray Cyrus</span></h2><p>Noah Cyrus is the youngest member of the family so of course, she looks up to her family members who are older than her. She said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>, "... None of us would even know what the music world is without my dad. I look up to my sister, but when people ask me about following in someone’s footsteps, I’m following in my dad’s footsteps. He’s my hero. I want to ask him to sign my t-shirt, I’m his biggest fan." Their family is filled with musical talent so, from a young age, Noah always had great examples to follow.</p><h2 id=billy-ray-cyrus-was-unaware-of-miley-cyrus-s-marijuana-habit-back-in-the-day><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Billy Ray Cyrus Was Unaware Of Miley Cyrus's Marijuana Habit Back In The Day</span></h2><p>When Miley Cyrus was 18 years old, some video&nbsp;footage of her smoking out of a bong hit the internet. The media went into a frenzy over it, of course. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy Ray Cyrus tweeted about the incident saying</a>, "Sorry guys. I had no idea. Just saw this stuff for the first time myself. I am so sad. There is much beyond my control right now."&nbsp;These days, Billy Ray, his wife <a href=#>Tish Cyrus</a>, and pretty much their whole family openly smokes marijuana recreationally since they reside in California where it is legal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-ray-cyrus-said-hannah-montana-destroyed-his-family><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Billy Ray Cyrus Said 'Hannah Montana' Destroyed His Family</span></h2><p>While talking about the hugely intense impact of Hannah Montana, Billy Ray Cyrus told<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> GQ Magazine,</a>&nbsp;"... The damn show destroyed my family. And I sit there and go, 'Yeah, you know what? Some gave all.' It is my motto, and guess what? I have to eat that one. I some-gave-all'd it all right. I some-gave-all'd it while everybody else was going to the bank. It's all sad." The show&nbsp;turned his daughter's name, Miley Cyrus, into a household name... but at what cost?

Typically, youngsters can get behind the wheel of a car when they are 15 and a half years old if they have their learner's permit and a legal adult over the age of 25 in the passenger's seat.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Why Noah Cyrus Hates Being Compared To Her Big Sister, Miley Cyrus</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>None of these things were applicable at the time.

She’s an artist. She’s real. I think that what’s happened over the years, Miley has been reinventing her sound. She’s evolving as an artist herself. I think that all of what everyone is calling controversy now, that’s still my Miley.” He still loved and respected his daughter despite any backlash the performance received at the time.</p><h2 id=miley-noah-amp-billy-ray-cyrus-enjoy-performing-together-onstage><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Miley, Noah, & Billy Ray Cyrus Enjoy Performing Together Onstage</span></h2><p>Now that Miley and Noah Cyrus have released a song together, seeing them perform together will be more of a regular thing.
