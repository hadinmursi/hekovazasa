Despite Adebiri commenting on Lopez's skillset as a vocalist, the 'Get Right' singer accepted a tearful apology from the comedian, who was "mortified" by the situation.</p><p>Jennifer Lopez revealed that the Bottoms actress approached her backstage at the sketch show to apologize. “She was mortified and very sweet,” Lopez said to Variety in a recent interview.</p><p>The Grammy-nominated artist and actress explained, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She came to my dressing room and apologized</a> with tears in her eyes, saying how terrible it was that she had said those things. She felt really badly and loved my performance because we had just done my soundcheck, and she actually got to hear me perform.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She was just like, ‘I’m so f****** sorry, it was so awful of me,’” Lopez added about Ayo Adebiri's apology.</p><p>Luckily, there appear to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no hard feelings between the two stars</a>. “It’s funny. I’ve heard similar things said about me throughout my career, so it really didn’t affect me,” Lopez laughed at the cutting comments from the comedy actress.</p><p>In the following, we look at how Ayo Edebiri insulted Jennifer Lopez, forcing her to apologize to the singer. We also reveal how Ayo Edebiri dealt with the backlash of her Jennifer Lopez comments and how other comedians might learn from her mistake.</p><h2 id=ayo-adebiri-39-s-harsh-comments-on-jennifer-lopez-39-s-career>Ayo Adebiri's Harsh Comments On Jennifer Lopez's Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jlo-and-ayo-edebiri-snl.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ayo Edebiri made the controversial comments about Jennifer Lopez during an appearance on the February 2020 episode of Laci Mosley's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scam Goddess</a> podcast. The Bear actress commented about the singer and performer, calling <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez's career</a> “one long scam.” The comments only resurfaced after the pair were booked to appear on the same episode of Saturday Night Live.</p><p>“Today I was actually thinking about one of my favorite scams of all time, because J.Lo is performing at the Super Bowl halftime show,” she said.</p><p>“Her whole career is one long scam.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jennifer-lopez-calls-raising-teen-twins-a-challenge-as-she-struggles-to-co-parent-with-ben-affleck-jennifer-garner.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Admits Her Kids Hate Her Music After Referencing Ben Affleck In New Song</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It's not only fans that aren't loving J.Lo's new music but also her teenage twins.</span><p>When the podcast host <a href=#>questioned Jennifer Lopez' singing skills,</a> the Golden Globe winner responded with, "Well, that's the thing. She thinks she's on multiple tracks, but it's not her. I think she thinks that she's still good even though, like, she's not singing for most of these songs."</p><p>"A lot of the write-ups of the songs will be like, 'J.Lo didn't have time to make it to the studio,' like, J.Lo was busy," she added.

We get it. It's wrong to leave mean comments or post comments just for clout, or run your mouth on a podcast, and you don't consider the impact because you're 24 and stupid," the Big Mouth star said in the skit. "But I think I speak for everyone when I say, from now on, we're going to be a lot more thoughtful about what we post online."</p><p>She has not addressed any of the comments since the sketch aired or Jennifer Lopez revealed Edebiri apologized backstage.</p><h2 id=how-tina-fey-urged-people-to-learn-from-ayo-adebiri-39-s-mistake>How Tina Fey Urged People to Learn From Ayo Adebiri's Mistake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50330370.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ayo Edebiri also addressed the situation on SNL cast member Bowen Yang’s Instagram page after Tina Fey used her as an example of a celebrity <a href=#>being a little too honest</a> on a podcast. <strong>Tina Fey believes more and more celebs will find themselves in hot water as they spout their honest opinions on podcasts.</strong></p><p>Tina Fey delivered advice to Yang at the end of his “Las Culturistas” podcast with Matt Rogers during their regular “I Don’t Think So, Honey” segment. The Mean Girls actress and writer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Yang he's too famous to give actual opinions on his podcast.</a></p><p>“Are you having a problem with Saltburn? Quiet luxury. Keep it to yourself,” Fey told the comedians. “Because what are you going to do when [Saltburn director] Emerald Fennell calls you about her next project where you play Carey Mulligan’s coworker in the bridal section of Harrods, and then Act 3 takes a sexually violent turn, and you have to pretend to be surprised by that turn?…" she started when discussing the Jacob Elordi movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You hang out with Ariana and SpongeBob now, that is your life, OK?” Fey said to Yang in reference to <strong><a href=#>Ariana Grande </a></strong>and Ethan Slater, his co-stars in the upcoming Wicked movie adaptation. “And Matt Rodgers, I can tell you, you got about one year left. <strong>Yes, learn from my mistakes.
