Now, the man is rumored to be dead in jail. Is this news true? Let’s discover the whole story here.</strong></p><p>On August 10, 2016, a video was uploaded on Youtube with the title “Psycho Old Man Smashes Windows Out With Baton” and the video soon caught the eye of everyone.</p><p>Later, the man was charged with mischief and he went to jail after a court case. Then, the man disappeared from the media and the story was almost forgotten by everyone. But after 5 years, his death news has again caught attention.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Obituary: Is Dennis Tissington Dead In Jail?">Obituary: Is Dennis Tissington Dead In Jail?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Dennis Tissington Age: How Old Is He?">Dennis Tissington Age: How Old Is He?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Dennis Tissington Family Revealed">Dennis Tissington Family Revealed</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Dennis Tissington Charges Explained">Dennis Tissington Charges Explained</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=obituary-is-dennis-tissington-dead-in-jail></span>Obituary: Is Dennis Tissington Dead In Jail?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After almost 6 years of the incident, many people are claiming that Dennis Tissington died in jail. But no official site has confirmed his death.</p><p>As of now, the story just seems to be a hoax. The man was already 67 years old in 2016 and now his age is 73. At this age, even a health condition is a great challenge to survive.</p><p>The video had brought a great debate on social media at that time and people were passing judgments over his action. People gave him the name of Angry Young Man at that time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dennis-tissington-age-how-old-is-he></span>Dennis Tissington Age: How Old Is He?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dennis Tissington is&nbsp; 73 years old by now. He was 67 when the incident took place.</p><p>Even at that age, he went with a baton to fight out his neighbor. The way he was speaking was quite unfamiliar and he used abusive words.</p><p>Although the incident became a hot topic, no one followed the case later. And we can’t be sure that he was jailed for a very long time for this minor mischief case.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dennis-tissington-family-revealed></span>Dennis Tissington Family Revealed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dennis Tissington was caught after the incident by police but officers refused to reveal his family.</p><p>After the incident, his family members came for his support, and his stepson, Tylor Stojan posted a video on Facebook captioning it as the other side of the incident.</p><p>He stated that Dallyn was threatening regularly other family members over the dispute which began in 2014. He also said that he had hired a lawyer and would file a defamation lawsuit against Dallyn.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dennis-tissington-charges-explained></span>Dennis Tissington Charges Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dennis Tissington was charged for attacking a man named Damian Dallyn. The incident happened in Canada and the case was filed in Mounties police station.</p><p>Damian shot the video and post it to social media. Later, he was charged for mischief following a confrontation. Damian suffered several injuries from his attack.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmm56mnp7AbsDIrKqippepvK951pqqZqCVYrOwwc2dZJ2dkZl6qrqMo5iipF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-twitter-thinks-dwts-carrie-ann-is-tough-on-kaitlyn-and-artem.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Twitter Thinks DWTS' Carrie Ann Is Tough on Kaitlyn and Artem">&larr;
