While Addison may have downloaded TikTok out of sheer boredom a while back, she clearly didn't get so far in Hollywood by sitting around doing nothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Addison Rae <a href=#>worked hard to build up her $5 million net worth</a> from zero, and fans love her for it. Of course, they also love her content, and she's one of the most beloved influencers out there (despite some missteps on Jimmy Fallon).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Addison Rae's Appropriative Dance On 'The Tonight Show' Sparked Some Backlash</a></span></p><p>These days, Addison is moving toward acting in addition to her TikTok branding, which likely means she'll continue to rake in the cash. The real question is, though: how is Addison Rae spending her net worth?</p><h2 id=how-is-addison-rae-making-money>How Is Addison Rae Making Money?</h2><p>To clarify her impressive net worth, sources say that Addison Rae amassed her $5 million in only a year, because of her endorsement deals plus merchandise. Fans of the TikToker have seen her rock Addison Rae-branded outfits, and there are collabs with Reebok, Hollister, and more to add up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What that means for her income is clear, but what it means for her spending isn't quite. After all, as an influencer, Addison Rae is probably posting up with a lot of free products. Still, there are a few things she clearly indulges in and spends her own hard-earned cash on.</p><h2 id=does-addison-rae-own-a-mansion>Does Addison Rae Own A Mansion?</h2><p>The first question about Addison Rae's net worth is whether she's invested some of it in a million-dollar home. Apparently, she has. Easterling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> bought a $3M home in Los Angeles sometime in 2019.</p><p>Her not-so-humble abode has six bedrooms, seven and a half baths, and has a pool plus amazing views of the tree-covered neighborhood. Fans can spot various features of the home in Addison's TikTok videos plus her Instagram posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=addison-also-shells-out-for-her-pets>Addison Also Shells Out For Her Pets</h2><p>Sure, her mansion is one way Addison is investing her cash. But she has a few other expenses to consider, too. For one thing, there's her Frenchie Bulldog, whose name is Maui.</p><p>Addison posts a lot of pup content, but fans don't always get to see her dog. In fact, Easterling seems to post with a handful of different dog breeds, and there's no telling exactly who they belong to.</p><p>But in one interview, Addison talked about gifts she was giving her pup for the holidays, so it's clear she has at least one dog that she loves to spoil.</p><h2 id=what-kind-of-car-does-addison-rae-drive>What Kind Of Car Does Addison Rae Drive?</h2><p>Some celebrities like to collect mansions, some collect bling, but what does Addison Rae like? Turns out, a hot pink Tesla Model X. At least, it used to be hot pink.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the car was ostensibly a gift from her dad, Addison only drove the pink car for a short time before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">completely redoing</a> it. She explained that it drew too much attention, especially at times when she just wanted to, say, hit up the drive-thru.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Livid TikToker Addison Rae Is Invited To The Met Gala Over Many Stars</a></span></p><p>So the TikToker repainted her car (that couldn't have been cheap!) so she could be a bit more incognito while going to Chick-fil-A. But before she owned the Tesla, Addison was also 'gifted' a white Jeep.</p><p>The thing is, she could definitely afford any kind of car she might want. But thanks to people (like her dad!) gifting her vehicles, she's likely only on the hook for her insurance and possibly some taxes. Smart way to save her net worth, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=addison-rae-does-travel>Addison Rae Does Travel...</h2><p>Fans can assume that when Addison Rae is working on, say, films like the upcoming 'He's All That,' she's getting paid for her flight time. But other times, Addison is likely footing her own bill for expenses.</p><p>Luckily, a lot of her picturesque sites for social media snaps appear to be local, but Addison doesn't always stick close to home. But anyone can tell the TikToker that travel is a good investment, so there's no point in stressing over spending a bit of cash on it (for the experience!).</p><h2 id=addison-reinvests-in-her-business>Addison Reinvests In Her Business</h2><p>Though she could probably live on her existing millions for a while, Addison is more business-minded than that. She's currently pushing her beauty brand ITEM Beauty, which is available at Sephora, so she's clearly put some cash flow into her business.</p><p>Though having <a href=#>BFF and "mentor" Kourtney Kardashian</a> repping for her probably helps, there's always money that needs to go into a new startup, and Addison likely worked hard to get the ball rolling. There's also the influencer's clothing line, which is bringing in income now, but had to get started somehow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Trailer For Addison Rae's 'He's All That' Movie Brutally Savaged By Fans</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbymv4yam52ho6S7br7AnmSsqJWjsW6BjKagpaSZpLtuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-long-has-marques-houston-been-married-religion-and-how-he-met-his-wife-explored-amid-online-backlash-578110-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How long has Marques Houston been married?
