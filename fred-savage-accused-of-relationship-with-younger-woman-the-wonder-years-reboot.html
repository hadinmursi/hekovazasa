Since the show went off the air in 1993, <a href=#>Savage has amassed quite a fortune</a>, landing regular roles in several other tv shows, including Working, The Grinder, and more recently, the Netflix dramedy Friends from College.Savage also recently revisited his Wonder Years days as he directed several episodes of The Wonder Years reboot. And while everyone thought that the actor’s Wonder Years reunion would be a good idea, it turned out to be his undoing.Recently, it was revealed that Savage was fired from the show following misconduct allegations. The actor also reportedly had a relationship with a younger woman while working on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=six-women-alleged-fred-savage-had-behavior-on-the-wonder-years-reboot-set>Six Women Alleged Fred Savage Had Behavior On The Wonder Years Reboot Set</h2><p>When news of Savage’s firing from the show was first revealed, 20th Television, who is producing the reboot series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">declined to go into further details</a>.</p><p>“Recently, we were made aware of allegations of inappropriate conduct by Fred Savage, and as is policy, an investigation was launched,” it said in a statement.</p><p>“Upon its completion, the decision was made to terminate his employment as an executive producer and director of The Wonder Years.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Social Media 'Not Shocked' As Fred Savage Is Fired For 'Inappropriate Conduct' On Set</a></span></p><p>Since then, however, it’s been revealed that the studio investigated Savage after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">six women from the crew of The Wonder Years came forward</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“To their credit, I was contacted within hours,” one of the women revealed. “An investigation started immediately, and he was barred from set.”</p><h2 id=on-set-fred-savage-revealed-his-dark-side-lsquo-his-eyes-would-go-dead-rsquo>On Set, Fred Savage Revealed His Dark Side: ‘His Eyes Would Go Dead’</h2><p>According to the women, Savage displayed two sides of himself while on the set, depending on who was around him.</p><p>“They all see his absolute perfect, best face,” a woman said of Savage’s demeanor when facing the cast and executives. When he was dealing with the crew, Savage would reportedly reveal an angrier side of himself.</p><p>“His eyes would go dead,” one claimed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Was Fred Savage's 'The Wonder Years' Canceled?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one point, Savage also allegedly made sexual advances toward a former female crew member whom he initially struck a close friendship with. It occurred in December 2021 when she met with some crew members and Savage at a bar after the actor followed her into the women’s restroom.</p><p>“He put his mouth on mine very forcefully. He went for the top of my pants. I brushed him away,” she recalled.</p><p>“Then he put his mouth on mine again, grabbed my hand and pulled it on his groin area. I was pulling back. He stopped very angrily. I shoulder-checked him so I could get out.” Savage has reportedly tried to get back in touch with her since the incident, but she decided to ignore his calls and messages.</p><h2 id=fred-savage-accused-of-having-a-lsquo-manipulative-and-erratic-rsquo-relationship-with-a-younger-woman>Fred Savage Accused Of Having A ‘Manipulative And Erratic’ Relationship With A Younger Woman</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the incidents with the show’s former and present crew members, it was also revealed that the actor had a relationship with a much younger woman on the crew.</p><p>It was also this alleged inappropriate relationship that prompted the women to ultimately report Savage to Disney HR.</p><p>While filming the show, the crew members learned that the young woman moved into the house where Savage was staying in Cabbagetown in Atlanta.</p><p>And while the woman herself declined to be interviewed, she did reveal to the crew that Savage went on to buy her gift as well as talk about their future together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Sweet Way Fred Savage Met His Wife Jennifer Lynn Stone</a></span></p><p>That said, the young woman also admitted to becoming fearful of Savage whenever he gets angry. An associate described that the actor was “extremely controlling of her daily behaviors” and that he was “manipulative and erratic.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-were-attempts-to-protect-the-woman-from-savage>There Were Attempts To 'Protect' The Woman From Savage</h2><p>Another crew member also revealed that she tried to protect the young woman from Savage, but this resulted in the actor targeting her instead. “He proceeded to verbally harass me and belittle me,” she revealed.</p><p>The same woman also witnessed the change in Savage’s behavior “when he pulled me aside multiple times when he was verbally harassing me, his eyes would go dead.” All of a sudden, however, “he flips a switch, and he’s Fred Savage.”</p><p>Prior to his Wonder Years controversy, Savage also faced similar accusations while working on his Fox show, The Grinder. At that time, the actor was cleared following the network’s investigation.</p><p>As for The Wonder Years reboot, the show was renewed for a second season following Savage’s exit. It is now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intent on putting his controversy behind them</a>.</p><p>“It was very difficult,” showrunner Saladin K.
