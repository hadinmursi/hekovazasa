Meghan and Harry, for their part, stepped back from their duties working under <a href=#><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong></a> in January 2020. They informed the <a href=#>94-year-old monarch last month that they would not be returning to the job</a> after relocating to Los Angeles with 21-month-old son Archie. Harry, 36, recently hinted at a difference between working for the queen and being part of the<a href=#> family during an appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden.</a></p><p>“It was a really difficult environment, as I think a lot of people saw,” Harry told <strong><a href=#>James Corden</a></strong> on February 25, adding that the couple views their decision as “stepping back rather than stepping down.”</p><p>The prince continued: “It was a really difficult environment, as I think a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like, and it was destroying my mental health. I was like, ‘This is toxic.’ So, I did what any husband and what any father would do, and I was like, ‘I need to get my family out of here.’ But we never walked away.”</p><p>Harry added that he and Meghan have “Zoomed” with his grandparents a “few times” since their final royal engagement in March 2020, noting they gifted Archie a waffle marker for Christmas.</p><p>“They’ve seen Archie running around. My grandfather, instead of pressing ‘Leave Meeting,’ he just [closes the laptop]. … I’m like, ‘OK, bye,’” he said of the 99-year-old prince, who is currently in the hospital after undergoing heart surgery.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The royal family has yet to publicly acknowledge Harry and Meghan’s CBS sit-down. The palace did, however, <a href=#>respond to The Times report alleging that Meghan mistreated staff</a> before the duke and duchess’ royal exit. (The former actress has denied the claims.)</p><p>“We are clearly very concerned about allegations in The Times following claims made by former staff of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Wednesday. “Accordingly our HR team will look into the circumstances outlined in the article. Members of staff involved at the time, including those who have left the Household, will be invited to participate to see if lessons can be learned The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace.”</p><p>A source told Us, meanwhile, that <a href=#>Harry and Meghan’s friends believe “that the palace has released this statement to strike back</a> at Harry and Meghan for doing the [tell-all] interview.” The source said: “The palace knows that they will not be cast in the best light by Harry and Meghan on Sunday and doesn’t want Harry and Meghan coming off as victims.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoKlisbCx0maknp%2BYlrtuucCroqWdXZiurbiMrZ%2BeZaKkxqK4jJ%2BYpqGcrnq1tMRmnaKqnWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./yaya-dacosta.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yaya Dacosta News - Us Weekly">&larr;
