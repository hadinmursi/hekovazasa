It was great news when the couple announced that they were getting married as Tinsley really wanted to find a partner to share her life with.</p><p>Well, following the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">end of Tinsley's time on </a>RHONY, it appears as if her engagement has also ended. So, what happened between the two?

After two breakups, Scott finally insisted on proposing to Tinsley in Chicago, where she moved in order to be with Kluth. Tinsley said goodbye to her NYC life and of course, RHONY!&nbsp;News broke that the couple split earlier this year, leaving just about everyone stunned. While Tinsley is keeping a low profile, Leah McSweeney is telling it like it is! Leah said she thinks Tinsley "dodged a bullet" all while mentioning how she and the ladies all look forward to having her back if she chooses to! Although Mortimer hasn't revealed if she'll return to the show, her former co-stars are welcoming her back with open arms.</p><h2 id=engaged-no-more>Engaged No More!</h2><p>While Tinsley Mortimer is super rich and has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $35 million</a>, her desire to search for love was definitely relatable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was sweet watching Tinsley find love with Scott, who she was introduced to by Carole Radziwill while filming&nbsp;RHONY. Viewers saw their first date, which was full of flirting and laughter, and it seemed like&nbsp;they had a great connection, ending the night off with a quick makeup sesh no less!</p><p>Tinsley Mortimer and Scott dated for four years, however, considering the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couple broke up twice</a>, it's safe to say it wasn't always smoothing sailing. According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, Tins and Scott started dating back in February of 2017, split up eight months later, and once they were back together, broke up again in June of 2018.</p><p>The&nbsp;engagement&nbsp;took place in November 2019 and it would have been wonderful to see Tinsley and Scott get a happy ending, however, news of their break-up came out in March 2021, shocking just about everyone, including Tinsley herself!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;"Tinsley feels like she wasted four years of her life on Scott," and we certainly don't blame her!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here’s What Kristen Taekman Has Been Up To Since Leaving ‘RHONY’</a></span></p><h2 id=it-s-over>It's Over</h2><p>Scott's friends say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wanted to end his engagement</a> from Tinsley a lot earlier than he did, which still doesn't shed him in the best light.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Page Six, a source said,&nbsp;“Her perception of when they broke up is clearly different from Scott’s, but Scott communicated to her that they were broken up months ago.”</p><p>The article also mentions that the couple was very on-again and off-again. A source explained that it seemed like because Tinsley left&nbsp;RHONY&nbsp;and wanted to make things work with Scott, she stayed with him despite the rocky nature of their constant splitting up and reuniting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The publication went on to explain how many of Tinsley Mortimer's friends were aware of the "unhealthy pattern," which Scott has been putting Tinsley through for the past 4 years, however, it appears as if the socialite was willing to leave everything behind just for a chance at things working out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Reason Bethenny Frankel Really Left ‘RHONY’</a></span></p><h2 id=return-to-rhony>Return&nbsp;To 'RHONY'?</h2><p>Fans will remember that when Tinsley left&nbsp;RHONY, she was moving to Chicago to be with Scott.</p><p>When asked about her reason for leaving, Tinsley made it clear that she wasn't given any type of ultimatum, as Scott would have totally been okay with her finishing the season. Despite that, she stars felt as if it was best for her to leave, saying,&nbsp;"I had just gotten back together with him, so yeah I chose him over being here with everybody."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tinsley shared with Andy Cohen that she had no regrets about moving to Chicago because "I really followed my heart and my gut,&nbsp;and I knew it was the right decision."</p><p>Now that Tinsley's engagement is over, people wonder if that means that she could join&nbsp;RHONY&nbsp;once again.</p><p>Although Tinsley Mortimer hasn't made it clear if she'll be returning to New York City let alone Real Housewives, her former castmates would be more than happy to have her back, especially gal pal, Leah McSweeney.</p><p>During an episode of Watch What Happens Live! Leah and the RHONY ladies discussed the duo's split, and while Leah tried to keep things civil, out of fear Scott would go after her "with lawyers", she still spoke her mind!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leah shared how she was happy for Tinsley's freedom and just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much of a mess she managed to avoid!</a> "She dodged a bullet!" Leah said.</p><p>McSweeney wasn't the only one who voiced their thoughts on Scott ending his engagement to Mortimer, Ramona Singer also chimed in!</p><p>"Who announces to the press that he stopped seeing her, who does that?" Singer said, sharing how she felt as if that was Tinsley's place to do so, and not his.</p><p>"I would love for her to come back, and I hope that she does!" Leah said as the ladies nodded in agreeance. While Tinsley Mortimer might be taking her sweet time to comment on the matter, fans are giving her ample time to heal from what was clearly quite the heartbreak.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What ‘RHOBH’ Star Crystal Minkoff Really Thinks Of Sutton Stracke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaeernq4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZpmerKeasq9506KlrKSVrnquu9GtoKadomKur7CMrJqorKRiuK3B06Fm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./90-day-fiances-jenny-and-sumit-still-together-amid-his-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="90 Day Fiance's Jenny and Sumit Still Together Amid His Divorce">&larr;
