And she wasn’t getting rid of this shocking news and wasn’t ready to accept it. So, she asked him to leave her alone.</p><p>Also, she criticizes him on IG live, although he posts a lot of photos with his kids, she revealed that he isn’t that kind of father.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=martell-holt-baby-mama-on-instagram></span>Martell Holt Baby Mama On Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Melody Holt was also known as Baby Mama is quite active on the Instagram handle with the username melodysholt.</p><p>There were rumors about her being together with her ex-husband.&nbsp; So, she replied with a post on her Instagram account and let her followers know by looking at her facial expression whether she was interested in patching up again with her husband or not.</p><p>Also, some people feel that she should be with her husband in any situation although he is with other women. She let people know that being separated from someone whom you adore your entire life requires extensive therapy and lots of energy.</p><p>She also added that knowing the fact that her husband’s behavior will not change, she will not encourage him to return to her.</p><p>Recently, she got an amazing opportunity to co-host at&nbsp;@theorionamphitheater. and she thanked her family and team for continuously supporting and pushing her to be the better version of herself.</p><p>She is back to the work and is fully enjoying her life, going on a vacation, and spending quality time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ig-details-of-arionne-curry></span>IG Details Of Arionne Curry<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arionne Curry is available on Instagram with the username @_arionne_ and has 67.7k followers.

In addition, her celebrity wife is a mixed-race American.</p><p>Also, the television personality was already married before she had a relationship with Arian.

Once Martell’s cousin had a house party, future lovers got to know each other. Martell asked Curry for her phone number.</p><p>The lovers started dating and traveled to various places. But until then, Curry didn’t know the truth about his relationship with the melody.</p><p>She said in an interview that she knew that Holt was married to his wife only about a year after they began dating,</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-arionne-curry-the-reason-behind-his-divorce></span>Is Arionne Curry The Reason Behind His Divorce?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Martell’s ex-wife Melody Holt (who tied the knot in July 2008), Martell said she had a close wedding and Martell tricked her into diplomatic relations with Arion.</p><p>In addition, his unfaithfulness destroyed their relationship and brought their marriage to divorce. Martell succeeded in dating Arion without revealing to her the truth that he was a married man.</p><p>In most YouTube videos, commentators accuse Arion and Martell of unfair behavior towards the melody.</p><p>Curry’s partner, Martell, also has his ex-wife and four children. Their children are Maria Selene, Maria, Martel, and Marani Holt.</p><p>In addition, Martell is very supportive and very close to the kids, but you can see him having fun with the kids on his social media accounts.</p><p>Things have become very annoying between him and his ex-wife, but Martell and Curry now have legal and physical custody of all children.</p><p>Before Curry became the mother of her son with Martell, she also had a daughter from her previous relationship. She often shares pictures of her girl on Instagram but hasn’t revealed anything about her baby’s father yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWVmsFuucCrq56knGK1sLjTZpmamqliuqK5wGamp2WZo8C1rcarmKZlp52utXnIrGSaqpmku6%2BxjKmpnqyVo7G0ecigZJ2dpJa2rb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mighty-ducks-20th-reunion-pictures-cast-recreates-the-flying-v-2014229.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mighty Ducks 20th Reunion Pictures: Cast Recreates the &amp;quot;Flying V&amp;quot;">&larr;
