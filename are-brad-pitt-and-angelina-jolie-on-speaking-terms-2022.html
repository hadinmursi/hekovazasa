Brangelina took the world by storm after getting together in 2005 and were one of the most globally adored couples in existence until their split in 2016. Fans almost couldn’t believe it when the couple announced they were going their separate ways after more than a decade together and two years as husband and wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things got messy between the two actors after Jolie filed for divorce in September of that year. <a href=#>Jolie alleged that Pitt was guilty of domestic abuse</a> after he got into an altercation with the couple’s adopted son Maddox on the family’s private jet. With a custody battle stretching across years and lawsuits flying between the exes, it seemed like their friendship had dried up as much as their romantic relationship. But are Pitt and Jolie on speaking terms now? Read on to find out!</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt>What Happened To Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt?</h2><p>After meeting on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2004, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie became the most famous couple on the planet. At the time, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston and Jolie was twice divorced.</p><p>In 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced their separation and in January 2006, Jolie announced that she was pregnant with her first child with Pitt. However, despite the timeline and the global media pitting Aniston and Jolie against each other, both Jolie and Pitt were adamant that their relationship didn’t begin until after Pitt was separated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Jennifer Aniston Ever Meet Angelina Jolie In Person?</a></span></p><p>In May 2006, Pitt and Jolie welcomed daughter Shiloh and the next year adopted Pax Thien from Vietnam. Jolie had already brought her two adoptive children, Maddox and Zahara to the relationship, who Pitt legally adopted too.</p><p>In July 2008, the couple welcomed twins Knox and Vivienne, and in 2014, they were officially married. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016</a>, citing irreconcilable differences.</p><p>According to The Evening Standard, the FBI and Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services confirmed they were investigating Pitt for alleged child abuse. The confirmation came after an incident took place on the family’s private jet, where Pitt was accused of physically harming one of his children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pitt was later cleared of allegations after it came to light that Maddox stepped in to defend Jolie after she and Pitt got into an altercation. A source at the time alleged that Pitt was also drunk at the time of the incident.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These 10 Angelina Jolie Movies Made More Than $100 Million</a></span></p><p>In 2017, Pitt revealed that he had a drinking problem during his marriage to Jolie: “I can't remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn't boozing or had a spliff, or something (via The Evening Standard). And I'm running from feelings. I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family.”</p><h2 id=are-angelina-and-brad-still-friends>Are Angelina And Brad Still Friends?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">media chronicling Brangelina’s split</a> reported that the couple were not on good terms at the end of 2016. However, Us Weekly confirmed in March 2017 that they were back on speaking terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They are in a place where they can put anger or hurt aside to focus on their children and how they plan to coparent,” an inside source told the publication. Another source explained that they were exclusively speaking about the children, but it was in the kids’ best interest for them to be civil towards one another.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Angelina Jolie's Relationship With The Weeknd</a></span></p><p>That said, The Evening Standard reports that, as of February 2022, <a href=#>Pitt is suing Jolie</a>.

But in 2021, she did give a rare interview where she opened up about her ex.</p><p>“I’m not the kind of person who makes decisions like the decisions I had to make lightly,” Jolie said in an interview with The Guardian. “It took a lot for me to be in a position where I felt like I had to separate from the father of my children.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Maleficent actress added that she feared for her “whole family’s” safety before getting divorced.</p><p>While she didn’t get into detail about exactly what went down between her and Pitt before the divorce, she did confirm that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wants her family to heal</a>: “And I want everyone to move forward—all of us, including their dad.
