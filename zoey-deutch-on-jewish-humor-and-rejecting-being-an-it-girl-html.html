Nobody can seem to agree on when, exactly, she’s going to be the Next Big Thing. In a way, this categorization makes sense: She’s got a Natalie Portman–melded–with–Jennifer Lawrence face, and her early work suggests a sort of safe, “It”-girlie trajectory. She plays the love interest in Richard Linklater’s <a href=#>Everybody Wants Some!!!</a>; she makes out with Zac Efron in <a href=#>Dirty Grandpa; </a>she’s the straight man to James Franco and Bryan Cranston in <a href=#>Why Him?</a> But what sets Deutch apart from her peers is that she’s funny. Like, really funny. High-octane, screwball, Lucille Ball funny.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hdv00283h66lpuenkqn@published data-word-count=155>Her more recent films have started to reflect that sense of humor. In 2018’s darkly comedic<a href=#> Flower,</a> she’s a phallus-obsessed teen who extorts grown men by giving them blow jobs, then demanding they pay her off before she exposes them. In last summer’s rom-com smash <a href=#>Set It Up</a>, Deutch plays a beleaguered editor’s assistant so desperate to reclaim her life that she schemes wildly with another exhausted assistant (Glen Powell) to trick their demanding bosses into falling in love. And in Buffaloed, a Fargo-esque small-town comedy premiering this week at the Tribeca Film Festival, Deutch is Peg Dahl, a blue-collar Buffalo resident bogged down by debt with dreams of financial freedom. After she’s sent to prison for selling knockoff Buffalo Bills tickets, then screwed over by a local debt-collection agency, she emerges with a new plan: She’ll start her own debt-collection agency, one that prioritizes humanity over profits (but still keeps her flush with cash).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8jzw003i3h66cnynrpjd@published data-word-count=90>The role is decidedly, purposefully unglamorous. Deutch spends most of the film with either zero makeup or garishly overapplied eyeliner, her hair piled atop her head and secured with a scrunchie, sporting oversize pantsuits. Buffaloed centers on Deutch’s natural comic timing — and her ability to carry an entire film with it. We caught up with Deutch before the premiere to talk about how being raised Jewish made her so funny, whether she’s frustrated by constantly being pegged as an up-and-comer, and holding Seders with her Catholic mom, Lea Thompson.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hgq002i3h66julp5yvh@published data-word-count=39><strong>Do you mind if we sit awkwardly close to each other on this couch? It’s just so loud in here I’m worried my phone won’t pick you up.</strong><br>[Laughs] There’s nothing awkward about this at all. Are you kidding me?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hfx002g3h6690zo4zeg@published data-word-count=177><strong>Tell me how this movie came to you and what appealed to you about it.</strong><br>I was shooting Set It Up in New York, and while I was shooting it, I got sent Buffaloed. I think in part it really appealed to me because it was so far away from what I was doing at the time. And I fell in love with Peg. I fell in love with her drive and her ambition and her will. And I came on as a producer, and we started looking for a director, and we found Tanya Wexler, who is really awesome. It’s only strange to me that she hasn’t already directed 12 huge blockbuster franchise movies. She’s so overqualified and capable and talented and prepared and calm under pressure. From the time [I got the script] until release, it only took two years. I think it’s a huge testament to Brian Sacca’s writing. He’s pretty smart and gifted. I’m a really shitty writer. Really, really bad. When anyone creates something that good out of nothing, I’m always in awe.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hf6002d3h66xfdloie0@published data-word-count=44><strong>What do you mean, you’re a shitty writer? Have you tried to write?</strong><br>I’m bad. I have 14,000 fluff words. Words that don’t need to be there. Even when I text or write my captions. I don’t even have captions on Instagram because I’m stupid.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hes002a3h66uyukwdms@published data-word-count=49><strong>I actually think you have really good captions </strong><a href=#><strong>on Instagram</strong></a><strong>. They’re very pithy.</strong><br>I probably paid my sister off to write one of them. Or begged my friend, like, “Just come up with anything, please. I’ll give you this dress in exchange for a caption.” A barter system of sorts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hhl002w3h66541gwduh@published data-word-count=59><strong>Speaking of which, you now have a short history of playing hustlers. What do you think that’s about?</strong><strong><br></strong>I like anti-heroes. They’re fun. They’re a little bit more unexpected. It’s fun to play someone that surprises you, even if you’ve prepared for months for a role — when you play someone like that, you’re jolted by surprise in the moment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hhu002z3h66mx7rmjyz@published data-word-count=46><strong>As a kid, or a teenager, did you ever scam or hustle in any way?</strong><br>Nope. Goody Goody Two-shoes. God, I don’t know. Everyone’s a walking contradiction of themselves. But no, I wasn’t a hustler or a scammer. Unless I’m hustling or scamming you right now.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hf4002c3h66rkzpktk7@published data-word-count=80><strong>That would be intense. How did you get the Buffalo accent down?</strong><br>The whole world is heightened, so it was tricky for me, because I wanted to stay true to a Buffalo accent, but I also wanted to make sure that it felt consistent with the world that was being created. We visited Buffalo a couple times, and I worked with a dialect coach named Liz Himelstein, who’s amazing, and she kept me in check. It’s such a bizarre, cool accent.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hhv00303h66cu501lpy@published data-word-count=55><strong>It sounds a little midwestern, too.</strong><br>Yeah, my mom [the actress <a href=#>Lea Thompson</a>]&nbsp;is from Minnesota, and there’s definitely a midwestern thing going on. And there’s actually a reason for that. I’m going to butcher it, but if you look it up —&nbsp;the lineage of Buffalo — it’s based in something that sounds like a midwestern accent.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hf1002b3h66fubymtb3@published data-word-count=41><strong>It’s also slightly Fargo-y.</strong><br>Actually, my dialect coach did Fargo. And she kept being like, “Dude, I know you think you’re going too far, but I’ll tell you a story about — ” and I’d be like, “Fargo. I know. I know.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hfn002f3h66h4kwas6y@published data-word-count=84><strong>The director described this movie as a “love letter to strong, inconvenient women.” You’ve been playing these sorts of women recently. Would you describe yourself that way? Do you see yourself that way?</strong><br>Do I see myself as a strong, inconvenient woman? I don’t think I identify with that. But I do identify with drive and having this real force and motivation that is kind of inexplicable. It’s totally self-inflicted, and I’m responsible, 100 percent, for being this way. You’re probably referencing Flower, too, right?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hhs002y3h66apsss7qc@published data-word-count=112><strong>Right.</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah, but my first couple jobs — I did two movies where I was the love interest. And it was really, really hard, because you’re trying so hard to deepen it, root it, ground it into something that it’ll never be. Because at the end of the day, as an actor, you’re just a piece of the puzzle. You’re not the whole thing. So it was exhausting and difficult. I learned my lesson — that it’s just too hard to [play a love interest]. It drives you crazy. You’re trying so hard to make something happen that isn’t going to happen. That’s probably why I have gravitated towards these strong, inconvenient women.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hf9002e3h66bz6ocuh0@published data-word-count=73><strong>Are you referring to Everybody Wants Some!!!?</strong><br>No, I’m not speaking about that, actually. I’m not going to name names. It doesn’t matter, but I did two [roles like that]. And then I was done. I don’t need to do it ever again. And it isn’t that they weren’t strong female characters. I think they actually were really strong female characters. Being present and loving and full of kindness is very strong to me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hg9002h3h66rn7bongy@published data-word-count=17><strong>And that’s all we’ll say about The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.</strong><br>[Laughs]<strong> </strong>Exactly. My illustrious career.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hh5002k3h66u3zy2wo1@published data-word-count=187><strong>When I was researching you, I found a brief aside where you mentioned you got your sense of humor from your Jewish dad. What did you mean by that, exactly?</strong><br>Yes! That’s the way that we would connect — if I made him laugh. He’s the funniest person I’ve ever met. He’s so crazy. Here’s a textbook neurotic-father-daughter outing: I was out of town for four months, and I came back, and my knee was hurting, so we did a whole week of doctor tours together. My dad [film director Howard Deutsch] and I went to every doctor in L.A. together. But the problem was, he was going with me to be a loving father and be there with me — and instead, he would just make it about himself and make appointments with those doctors. I started recording them, and I have a whole series of the most ridiculous conversations. He would literally walk in and be like, “Okay, I have a question. Can I make an appointment on this day?” And he would go to different floors and talk to different doctors. This was last week.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hif00333h6648tp4bqs@published data-word-count=32><strong>It’s similar with me and my Jewish dad. We just sort of fuck with each other constantly.</strong><br>Yeah. We just ruthlessly make fun of him, and he loves it. It’s great. It’s amazing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hha002o3h66av82lnq1@published data-word-count=54><strong>How would you characterize the Jewish humor in your family or Jewish humor generally? How does it feel different to you?</strong><br>I was just talking about that. And I don’t know if it’s self-deprecating. It doesn’t feel sarcastic to me. But it’s not witty British humor. I’m not sure — how would you describe it?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hh9002m3h66a0a7ow74@published data-word-count=9><strong>I think it’s morbid.</strong><br>Maybe it is morbid.

My family and I have this joke, whenever we talk about someone who’s dead, we’ll be like, “They’re still dead.”</strong><br>Yes! Literally.<strong> </strong>Yes. Yes. Yes. I don’t know how you’d describe it, but it is such a cool part of the culture. It obviously was meant to help us survive and to deal with all the craziness. You had to laugh. And that’s something that I really value and I’m grateful to have seen in my parents: laughter during difficult times, which I do actually qualify as a characteristic of the culture.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hnt00343h661gc89myy@published data-word-count=7><strong>Your mom is not Jewish, right?</strong><br>No, no.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8ih300363h663pucm2lt@published data-word-count=87><strong>Does she feel a little bit left out of the fold in that regard?</strong><br>She’s the one who organizes the Pesach Seder. I would say she’s more Jewish than my dad. But no, she was raised Catholic. So the good news is, is that I’m technically half-Catholic, half-Jewish, which means I have a whole lot of guilt. But I did get my 23andMe, or whatever — the ancestry thing. It said I was 51 percent Jewish. So I guess it’s really tipping that way. Have you done that?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8ihk00383h66rhxhn2mf@published data-word-count=72><strong>No, I wanted to, but then my boyfriend was like, “You don’t want our genes sitting around in some office.”</strong><br>I know. Someone said that to me and I was like, “Fuck.” But also, what’s crazy is that you get email. I just got an email this morning that was like, “We have new information about you. Your third cousin is …” The more people that do it, the more information they have.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8ii000393h66og09cqgj@published data-word-count=106><strong>So they have this file on you and who you’re related to? Seems really cool.</strong><br>Super-safe and harmless. Doesn’t freak me out at all. But I got a DNA test for my dog. And then I was like, If I got one for my dog, I should get one for me, ’cause that’s weird that I just did it for my dog. I wanted my self-care to be on the same page. I was like, “Wait a minute. I just bought you a $200 collar. I haven’t bought myself anything for $200 in a long time.” And then I didn’t. But I did get my DNA test.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8hha002n3h66hfxje8a5@published data-word-count=13><strong>You’re probably fine.

And that’s just totally not relevant to anything, but I just remembered it. I wore the ugliest silver BCBG dress that I found at a Goodwill. It’s the ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Ever. I mean, it’s almost impressive how ugly it is. I was like, “Mom, can I get my eyebrows waxed?” And she was like, “Okay, fine, do it.” And so I got really thin eyebrows. But the problem is I didn’t know I was allergic to whatever wax they were using, so not only did I have little tiny eyebrows that looked weird, I also broke out into a rash on my whole face. Then I had to wear this much makeup. So I looked like a wax figure in a really ugly silver BCBG dress. And I made everyone watch my entrance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjv2r8ja4003f3h66l3xkgxt7@published data-word-count=14><strong>The dance routine.</strong><br>I did a full-blown, really embarrassing dance number.
