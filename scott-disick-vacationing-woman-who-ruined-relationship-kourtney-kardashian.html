She threw a crochet dress over the swimsuit when out of the water.

The duo have been infamously on-and-off in the past, though they haven’t been linked in nearly a decade.</p><p>Scott and Chloe’s romance isn’t only raising eyebrows amongst fans because of their age difference, but also because of their history. Chloe was allegedly part of the reason Kourtney broke up with Scott for good in 2015, shortly after they welcomed their third child, son Reign.</p><p>Photos published in July 2015 showed Scott and Chloe together in Monte Carlo, while Kourtney presumably was home with their newborn. Moreover, Scott had allegedly been unfaithful in the past, a topic that explored on Keeping Up on the Kardashians numerous times.</p><p>Scott did later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">address their break-up in the show</a>, admitting his actions were to blame. "I made the worst decision I've ever made in my life," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-struggled-seeing-kourtney-move-on-with-travis-barker>Scott Struggled Seeing Kourtney Move On With Travis Barker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kourtney-kardashian-with-travis-barker.jpg><p>Scott and Kourtney also had an on-and-off relationship for years, so there was speculation they would reunite, even after he seemed to step out on her with Chloe. However, that never happened.</p><p>"Kourtney is 100% over Scott," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Entertainment Tonight in 2016.</a> "Not in a hateful way at all, but she has completely moved on."</p><p>"She is the happiest she's been in a really long time -- since probably before Mason was born," they continued.

She's spending a lot of time with her girlfriends, is planning dinners and nights out. She's happy and glowing."</p><p>Kourtney began dating Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker in 2021 and they married last year in multiple ceremonies, including a star-studded one in Italy. She gave birth to their son, Rocky, in November after revealing she used IVF treatments.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott has expressed feeling left out</a> of the Kardashian-Jenner family since Kourtney and Travis began dating, while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports say he’s struggled seeing her marry</a> someone else (though he proposed several times, Kourtney never accepted Scott’s hand in marriage during their relationship).
