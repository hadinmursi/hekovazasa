But for many, Nancy Meyers' The Holiday is the one to beat. The Kate Winslet, Jack Black, Jude Law, and Cameron Diaz film was a deeply romantic, funny, and downright heartwarming bit of escapism, ideal for the holiday season or basically any time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Holiday was also wildly successful, leading to <a href=#>the cast making an absolutely insane amount of money</a>. But not every star from The Holiday has continued to find success in the limelight. The girls who played Jude Law's daughters both have basically disappeared from the business.</p><p>Despite attempting to have a career in show biz, Miffy Englefield, who played Sophie, really struggled after The Holiday came out. During<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an interview with Vulture,</a> the actor revealed that this has led her to have some pretty mixed feelings about the film.</p><h2 id=what-is-miffy-englefield-from-the-holiday-doing-now>What Is Miffy Englefield From The Holiday Doing Now?</h2><p>Miffy Englefield stole her scenes as Jude Law's daughter, Sophie alongside Emma Pritchard, who played her sister Olivia. Despite the film focusing on the romantic and sexual chemistry between the adult characters, the girls both had their moments to shine in the Nancy Meyers flick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But aside from a couple of other small projects after The Holiday, Miffy basically vanished from the limelight.</p><p>So, what is she doing now?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These 10 Child Actors Avoided The Common Pitfalls And Became Successful Stars</a></span></p><p>"I do a lot of music stuff, at the moment. I play a lot of gigs," Miffy told Vulture when she was asked about what has kept her busy since The Holiday came out. "My partner’s in a band as well, that gets to tour around America and things like that. So I get to go to a lot of his shows. In my spare time I still read monologues, I still write a lot and watch a lot of films."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Glamour Magazine UK,</a> Miffy and her partner also gave birth to their first child in 2020. But the process wasn't easy. Miffy was rushed to have a c-section after a 21-hour labor that caused her to get an infection. Fortunately, both she and the baby survived.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Forgot That These Two ‘The Holiday’ Stars Used To Date</a></span></p><p>On top of starting a family, Miffy, who is now in her mid-20s, works as a barista as well as plays various gigs in the punk rock scene. She also makes TikTok videos, some of which address her childhood on the set of The Holiday and how creepy men talk about how she looks now versus then. This tends to be one of <a href=#>the cons of being a child star</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-miffy-englefield-has-issues-with-the-holiday>Why Miffy Englefield Has Issues With The Holiday</h2><p>During her interview with Vulture, Miffy explained how she kept her family issues a secret from the world following the success of The Holiday. Unlike a lot of child stars, Miffy grew up in immense poverty and needed to take work in order to help her single father take care of her and her siblings. Unfortunately, her family life ultimately led her to leave the industry.</p><p>"The Holiday helped quite a lot with being able to keep up with doing acting and things like that," Miffy said to Vulture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But my dad is a single parent, he’s got another two kids, my brother and sister. So if you have another two children that need you, you can’t be putting all your time into one kid. So as soon as I got to the age of 11, and my brother and sister were 10 and 9, they’d started to realize what was going on, and it became apparent to me and my dad that we couldn’t do this. It was causing a lot of arguments and fights. And the stress of coming from where we came from, living in the place we were coming from, it just didn’t make sense for us at the time to continue."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Kate Winslet Thought She’d Get Fired From ‘The Holiday’</a></span></p><p>Although Miffy left the film industry, she couldn't escape her past. She claimed that kids at school were "a bit funny" about the fact she used to be an actor.</p><p>And this altered her relationship with the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I used to hate it. Between the ages of about 12 to 15, I was angsty — 'Oh, I don’t want to talk about it, I was so young.' During that stage, I couldn’t watch it, would have a go at anyone who brought it up. Now, obviously, I’m in my 20s, and I can realize, 'Oh my God, that was actually quite a cool thing I did.' I was a weird-looking, slightly cute kid. That’s fine."</p><p>Miffy has found a life in the punk rock scene where people couldn't care less about her history in the business. This has no doubt helped her find warmer feelings about her past experiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dnbyttcOasGabkajBbrnIn52yZZWjtK2xxaKcpZxdrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./just-how-dirty-is-nymphomaniac-volume-i-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Just How Dirty Is Nymphomaniac: Volume I?">&larr;
