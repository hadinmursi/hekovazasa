Once the Vancouver-based brand debuted in 2009, we immediately saw a shift. Starting out with their classic collection, each piece was created to include modern functionality and unique detailing while keeping in mind the consumer’s daily routine.</p><p>The brand quickly upped the ante with three collections: <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">The Studio Collection</a> that highlights unique and unconventional styles, the Bad Hills Workshop that combines old and new styles for a modern touch and the <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Kids Collection</a> full of lively patterns and a functional style to allow our little ones to make an adorably stylish statement.</p><p>What we love most about this brand is that there is a construction to suit every aspect of our lives. Whether we’re heading to the gym, going out of town for the weekend or heading to school and work, there is a design that will carry our essentials with ease. From backpacks, totes, duffel bags and more, the possibilities are truly endless for a classic, yet refined appeal.</p><p>Ready to give your bag vault a trendy update?
