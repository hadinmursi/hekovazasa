And yet, she's grappled with some truly adult topics in her work. This is excluding her star-making performance in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, AKA <a href=#>the only good Ghostbusters sequel</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Grace's more emotionally challenging work has been in The Handmaid's Tale and Friend of the Family, in which she plays a very real person who was kidnapped and abused by a loved one not once but twice. It's heavy stuff. Enough for one to wonder how such a young woman can get into and out of that dark headspace.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mckenna Grace pulled back the curtains on her process and what it all means to her.</p><h2 id=who-is-mckenna-grace-in-the-handmaid-39-s-tale>Who Is Mckenna Grace In The Handmaid's Tale?</h2><p>Mckenna Grace plays Esther Keys in the acclaimed Hulu series. Alongside <a href=#>her acclaimed and wealthy castmates</a>, Grace tackles some truly uncomfortable topics. This includes her fifth-season storyline which is so dark that we can't even talk about it here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the plotline allows Grace to show off her remarkable acting skills in an uncomfortably honest way.</p><p>After finding out that she is pregnant with the baby of the man who took advantage of her, Grace's character absolutely loses it. In her interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Friend of the Family and Ghostbusters: Afterlife star revealed that she authentically felt so angry about what her character went through. This is how she was able to "tap into" her unbridled rage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I guess I was just enraged for Esther and what she’s been through," Grace admitted, referring to the scene where she's handcuffed in the hospital bed. "I don’t feel that type of rage through my day-to-day life. I kind of just do it and then after, come out of it to realize I’ve been doing this for hours, and I kind of don’t know where I went. I had these massive bruises on my wrist for going so ham. My wrists were so crazy swollen and bruised the next day."</p><h2 id=mckenna-grace-plays-jan-broberg-in-friend-of-the-family>Mckenna Grace Plays Jan Broberg In Friend Of The Family</h2><p>Peacock's Friend of the Family is a miniseries <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a horrific true story</a>. Mckenna Grace plays Jan Broberg, a woman who suffered tremendous pain at the hands of a close family friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’m honored to have been able to be a part of telling her story. I think it’s really important to get her story out there to hopefully educate people and show people [what happened]. Hopefully, people will understand," Mckenna Grace said during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Jake Lacy Kept The Real Jan Broberg At A Distance While Filming A Friend Of The Family</a></span></p><p>Playing Jan Broberg is no doubt an unparalleled emotional challenge. It also comes with a lot of criticism.</p><p>"To be playing these young women who are going through this, because it’s exactly what I say all the time about playing my age in Handmaid’s Tale: If we’re that uncomfortable with me acting out these scenes, why aren’t we doing something for the young women who are going through it?" Grace said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Dramatic roles, to me, are the most fulfilling as an actor, but also I find that these stories are important to tell and that I’m able to be a part of something that’s bigger than myself. To be able to talk about it and have a bit more of a platform to educate people, I think that’s incredible."</p><h2 id=how-mckenna-grace-separates-herself-from-her-dark-characters>How Mckenna Grace Separates Herself From Her Dark Characters</h2><p>Perhaps part of the reason why Mckenna Grace is able to move through her extremely dark roles is that <a href=#>she's managed a medical condition in secret for years</a>. Most people wouldn't have had a clue that she was going through something so traumatic. She just kept her strength, her grace, and did her job. In other words, she's good at separating aspects of her life to be in a given moment.</p><p>But in her interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Mckenna Grace revealed that she has another trick for moving away from all of the horrible things her characters deal with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Luckily, I’ve always had my parents, who have always been so supportive of me and my decisions in acting. So outside of acting, I have my family and my dog and my own life that I can separate from my roles," Grace admitted to The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Yvonne Strahovski's Brutally Honest Thoughts About Serena Being The Villain Of The Handmaid's Tale</a></span></p><p>On top of this, the Handmaid's Tale star credits music as being her savior from the darkness. Much like Sadie Sink's character in Stranger Things, Mckenna is able to let the rhythm carry her away from the trauma her characters endure.</p><p>"I listen to a lot of music to get into a place, and then I listen to a lot of music to get out of a place. Just the other day, I was crying in the car, listening to something because it reminded me of one scene. Music does that to me, and I find that’s really helpful," Grace said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bradley Whitford's Real Feelings About His Mostly Villainous Character On The Handmaid's Tale</a></span></p><p>Grace went on to say that all of the roles she's played have helped to form her as a person. So they also weigh heavily on her.</p><p>"But it’s an emotion you trick yourself into feeling, and then you have to figure out how to disassociate it from your real emotions. I’ve definitely had times where I look back at a scene where I did something all day that is a super dramatic, high-intensity scene, and it will give me a little bit of anxiety because my body thought it was real even though my mind knows it wasn’t," Grace admitted to The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>"So it’s all sorts of mixed feelings, but at the end of the day, it’s acting and emotions I leave at work."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknKOVo7uiecarmJydXZu%2FqrHNnWSonl2ptaZ5xZqkoqSpYrWiusOmmKKco2LBorjEZpqhmaKWsLWx0axm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meet-the-music-producer-behind-rihannas-hit-rude-boy-2010293.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet the Songwriter Behind Rihanna's Hit &amp;quot;Rude Boy&amp;quot;">&larr;
