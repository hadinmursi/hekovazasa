The pair discussed the now-infamous “walk out” that took place at the conclusion of the pay-per-view. Aries had gone in as champion, but he ultimately lost the IMPACT World Championship to Johnny Impact in the main event. He was then seen storming out after no-selling Impact’s finisher, and fans believed that a legitimate incident had taken place.</p><p>Austin Aries has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maintained</a> that it was all staged, pointing to IMPACT cameras continuing to film him after he allegedly went off-script. He told Fall that the plan was for a rematch with Johnny. However, that never happened because he never came back to the company.</p><p>Aries’ contract ended up expiring. He told Fall that his main regret was actually not following up on the BFG incident.</p><p>“So, my only regret for that whole situation was passing on the contract offer that was put on the table after that. We — I never talked about some personal things I was going through at the time, and I just decided that it was in my best interest not to re-sign there. In retrospect, in hindsight, however many years later, I would have made that decision differently,” Aries said.</p><p>“But that definitely created the perception that — you know, I don’t come back. There is no rematch, there’s no payoff to this. It would seem like I went into business for myself. That was really, looking back, I could kick myself because it really wasn’t for the actual Bound For Glory [moment],” he pointed out. “It was for not following through with what was planned.”</p><h2 id=h-a-potential-reunion>A potential reunion?</h2><p>Aries noted how the story continues to follow him today. He joked that if a match doesn’t go down as planned, it’s called “pulling an Austin Aries.” Still, he hopes he one day gets a chance to go back to IMPACT and leave on better terms.</p><p>“I created something that will live in infamy for a long time. It’s all good. I do hope that at some point, I do get to go back to IMPACT and at least leave in a different way. My intention was never to be the last thing that fans there saw me was me giving them the double bird as I stormed off to the back. That was never — that’s not how I wanted to ‘end scene’ for my career there,” he said. “I’ve had a lot of great moments there and I owe that company a lot of my success. So we’ll see. I’m still going at it, they’re still chugging along and maybe down the road we’ll reunite.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqb21sZWKutr%2FToqVmmaKesrR50qGYq52jYrWqv4yopaWxXaeyqL7ErWSamp%2BqwW61zZ%2BYpqelqHqju9Snm2aen6d6qLjOq7BmoZ6YtqWxza0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ballers-recap-season-1-episode-10-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ballers Finale Recap: Everythings Fine">&larr;
