You might think I would be doing the worst things with this girl because of her tapes, but it was the exact opposite of any other encounter I’ve had with a woman: with Kim, I wanted to be nothing but a gentleman to her. It was so weird.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shanna-Moakler-I-Filed-Divorce-After-Travis-Kim-Kardashian-Affair-003.jpg><p>The “I Think I’m OKAY” musician insisted that he looked, but “never touched” Kim amid his rocky relationship with Moakler.</p><p>Barker later <a href=#>gushed to Us in 2015</a> about Kim’s look, saying, “How could you not stare at Kim? Mind you, I enjoyed hanging out with Paris, but I love curvy girls. Kim was eye candy. I was in no way disrespectful to Paris, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off Kim.”</p><p>Moakler told Us on Tuesday, however, that the musician is “100 percent” lying about not hooking up.</p><p>“Someone sent me all their [text] conversations and I’m also close friends with people who were there, while things were happening,” the Rhode Island native said, noting <a href=#>she signed the divorce papers in 2008</a> after four years of marriage because of Barker’s infidelity.</p><p>According to Moakler, Barker hooked up with Kim before <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> came out in 2007. Over the years, Kim denied that there is any truth to Moakler’s claims.</p><p>“He had already had an affair with Paris Hilton. And … at the time Kim was Paris’ closet organizer, they were best friends. And he started using [the <a href=#>KKW Beauty founder</a>] as a model for [his clothing company], Famous Stars and Straps,” Moakler explained on Tuesday.</p><p>The model, who shares <a href=#>son Landon, 17, and daughter Alabama, 15</a>, with the rocker, claimed she asked Barker “not to use” Kim as a model because of her ties to <a href=#>The Simple Life</a> star.</p><p>“We were working on our marriage and trying to heal through that affair, that infidelity, [but] he continued to [work with her],” she said. “And then I received all the text messages and the other third parties kind of let me know. It’s something I was well aware of.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shanna-Moakler-I-Filed-Divorce-After-Travis-Kim-Kardashian-Affair-004.jpg><p>The former pageant queen admitted she doesn’t know why Barker allegedly lied about his affair with the TV personality, but she laughed, “He is dating her sister now, so I think that would be really weird.”</p><p>When it comes to Kourtney, 42, Moakler revealed she “didn’t even know Kourtney existed” at the time of Barker and Kim’s alleged romance.</p><p>Moakler, who is <a href=#>dating model <strong>Matthew Rondeau</strong></a>, explained that she has “no desire” to speak with Kourtney either after she started dating Barker last year. Instead, she is focused on being a mom and working on her Skinny Dippers swimsuit line, which is coming out soon.</p><p>“I’m really proud [of the line],” she said. “[I’m] very excited to do it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly reached out to rep for comment.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGju6J5zKiYpKSVp3qqecKarKCgpGLBs63VoqpmmpGnuKa%2BjKSgpmWblr%2BlrdKhoJqmXZ2ut7XNoGSanpaWtrN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./simon-rex-says-he-was-bribed-to-lie-about-dating-meghan-markle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Simon Rex Says He Was Bribed to Lie About Dating Meghan Markle">&larr;
