Since the show gave us a wacky sitcom with real depictions of friendship, it’s no surprise that we loved each of the hilarious roommates. But none was more surprisingly likeable than Max Greenfield’s Schmidt. Starting out as a "douchey" straight-laced guy’s guy, we soon fell in love with his quirky antics and his iconic on-and-off relationship with Cece.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Max Greenfield Meet His Wife Tess Sanchez?</a></span></p><h2><span class=item-num>8 </span><span></span></h2><p>Greenfield played this character so well that we not only laughed alongside him but rooted for him through his rocky relationship with Hannah Simone's Cece and through his journey to find himself beyond being a gross womanzier. So the question of the hour is, since New Girl came to a close in 2018, what has Max Greenfield been doing with his career? Well, the answer is being busy; Greenfield has since done a lot after his amazing New Girl run. Here is what his life looks now that he put the Schmidt away for good and started fresh.</p><h2 id=voicing-acting-king><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Voicing Acting King</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While his on-camera work is raved over, Max Greenfield is also well versed in using his voice to make an impact on the small screen, both before and after his time on New Girl. He was the voice of Boo Boo in the hilarious adminated show, Bob Burgers. He also voiced a handful of voices for Adult Swim’s Robot Chicken. After his New Girl stint, he returned to his voice acting. He voiced Maximilian Banks on Netflix’s Bojack Horseman. He even reunited with fellow New Girl co-star Jake Johnson (known to fans as Nick) to voice Lonnie Seymour in the adult cartoon Hoops.</p><h2 id=bestselling-author><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bestselling Author?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Set to be released in November, Max Greenfield has written a picture book for children called I Don’t Want to Read This Book. This kids book is designed for children who do not like to read books, making it easy for children to develop their reading skills and learn to love it. While it’s not out yet, many fans have pre-ordered the book and can’t wait for its release. Illustrated by good friend Mike Lowery, this book will definitely be one to remember.</p><h2 id=dipping-his-toes-in-tv-favorites><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dipping His Toes In TV Favorites</span></h2><p>Greenfield is a man who wears many hats, whether he’s our main focus or a supporting hand, which is why his guest star appearances are always a fun shock. He has appeared in smash hits like Ryan Murphy’s The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story and American Horror Story: Hotel. He has also shown his face in less serious projects, like the hilarious The Mindy Project and Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events as three separate brothers. He even appeared in the comedy No Activity for a few episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Was Megan Fox Paid On 'New Girl'?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-surprise-reprisal><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>A Surprise Reprisal</span></h2><p>Everybody loves a comeback, and Veronica Mars is no exception. When the revival of the show was announced, many were excited to see what became of our favorite private investigator. And with all TV show reboots or reunions, we wondered who else would return from the original. So many fans were delighted to see Max Greenfield pop back onto the scene as Leo D’Amato (even those who didn’t love his character in the first place, got a kick out of seeing him back).</p><h2 id=hitting-the-big-screen><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Hitting The Big Screen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not just one to stay on the small screen, Max Greenfield also tried his hand in movies. In 2019, he played the supporting role of Kevin Myrtle in the rom-com What Men Want starring Taraji P. Henson. He also played the character of Joe in 2020’s Promising Young Woman. He is also set to act in the upcoming rom-com The Valet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Are 'New Girl' Stars Jake Johnson And Max Greenfield?</a></span></p><h2 id=philanthropist><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Philanthropist</span></h2><p>Max Greenfield has also dabbled in philanthropy, working for the Young Storytellers Foundation on numerous projects. He has since stated that he was inspired by his children. He has two kids, eleven-year-old Lilly and six-year-old Ozzie. He has even donated a portion of his pre-order book sales to the organization. He has also supported other youth and health groups, such as the LA Children’s Hospital.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-leading-man><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Leading Man</span></h2><p>Looks like being a hit in a comedy show is just Max Greenfield’s forte. After his seven year run on a TV show, many would think that he would want to take a break since series are fun but a lot of hard work. But Max Greenfield is unique, since it seems like this guy loves to stay busy as he hopped into a new show the same year his old one called it quits. Since the conclusion of the beloved New Girl, Max Greenfield has played the role of David Johnson in CBS’ sitcom The Neighborhood, currently in its fourth season. He replaced Josh Lawson after the show’s pilot episode, and no offense to Lawson, but it definitely was the right call and we’re all the better for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Are The 'New Girl' Cast Members Friends In Real Life?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmpJqwXZy%2FprHNn6CepJRiuaqyxGajqKebYrmqt8RmmJ%2Bslad6r7HWZp6iqpxk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-slaughterhouse-heres-what-former-members-are-doing-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Slaughterhouse?
